    "### Context\n",
    "Forecasts aren’t just for meteorologists. Governments forecast economic growth. Scientists attempt to predict the future population. And businesses forecast product demand—a common task of professional data scientists. Forecasts are especially relevant to brick-and-mortar grocery stores, which must dance delicately with how much inventory to buy. Predict a little over, and grocers are stuck with overstocked, perishable goods. Guess a little under, and popular items quickly sell out, leading to lost revenue and upset customers. More accurate forecasting, thanks to machine learning, could help ensure retailers please customers by having just enough of the right products at the right time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Current subjective forecasting methods for retail have little data to back them up and are unlikely to be automated. The problem becomes even more complex as retailers add new locations with unique needs, new products, ever-transitioning seasonal tastes, and unpredictable product marketing."

    "### Potential Impact\n",
    "If successful, you'll have flexed some new skills in a real world example. For grocery stores, more accurate forecasting can decrease food waste related to overstocking and improve customer satisfaction. The results of this ongoing competition, over time, might even ensure your local store has exactly what you need the next time you shop."

The training data includes dates, store and product information, whether that item was being promoted, as well as the sales numbers. Additional files include supplementary information that may be useful in building your models."

    "* NOTE: Pay special attention to the transferred column. A holiday that is transferred officially falls on that calendar day, but was moved to another date by the government. A transferred day is more like a normal day than a holiday. To find the day that it was actually celebrated, look for the corresponding row where type is Transfer. For example, the holiday Independencia de Guayaquil was transferred from 2012-10-09 to 2012-10-12, which means it was celebrated on 2012-10-12. Days that are type Bridge are extra days that are added to a holiday (e.g., to extend the break across a long weekend). These are frequently made up by the type Work Day which is a day not normally scheduled for work (e.g., Saturday) that is meant to payback the Bridge.\n",
    "* Additional holidays are days added a regular calendar holiday, for example, as typically happens around Christmas (making Christmas Eve a holiday)."
