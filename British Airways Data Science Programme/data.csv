i had the most fantastic ba flight today. the cabin crew in my seat zone 6d were of the best i have experienced. although the 777 had the old style rear/front seating - it was comfortable and felt open and spacious. ba have done great things with the menu - it was nice not to have to eat breakfast food on the pre-arrival meal into hkg at 1730pm local time having left london at 2200 the night before. the dinner offering was equally ample and delicious. the inflight entertainment had a great collection of tv and current films and the inflight map was first rate. previously not a huge ba fan - but after this 12 hour flight i could only recommend it without reserve. i flew the new ba suite in j class on a recent delhi to london flight and enjoyed that product (although i felt it slightly more cramped ) but i think ba have stepped up with really comfortable bedding and food and very friendly crew who engaged throughout the flight in the best way. couldn't recommend ba more on this flight today,1st August 2023,Hong Kong,Business Class,yes,5,Heathrow to Las Vegas,Family Leisure,Yes,Positive

"london heathrow to mumbai in a boeing 787-8 in business class. the lounge near terminal 5, gate b36 at heathrow was outstanding in its service and offerings. it provides us just the right frame to relax in before boarding as the departure was delayed by almost 2 hours. the 787-8 on our flight featured the older club world seating. not the best in class but comfortable enough. i hear that the new club suites configuration is far superior. british airways onboard service was outstanding in every respect. all in all, a very comfortable flight. one minor irritant: for some reason this aircraft was not fitted with wifi. we got into mumbai at 8 am, a civilized time to arrive.",31st July 2023,Iceland,Business Class,yes,3,Gatwick to Venice,Solo Leisure,Yes,Positive
"keflavík, iceland to london heathrow on an a320 in business class. the journey got off on an unpleasant note - the business class line at keflavík was so long that it looked like an economy class check-in. it took over 30 mins to get through. there was no lounge access offered. the boarding process was well handled. british airways business class seats for the club europe product are terrible - exactly the same as economy with the middle seat left vacant. you don't even get extra pitch. what made the overall product tolerable were the good onboard service and the inflight wifi. also the fact that the flight leaves at a convenient mid-morning time of 10:40 am.",31st July 2023,Iceland,Business Class,yes,5,London to Luanda,Couple Leisure,Yes,Neutral
"terrible experience with british airways. i booked a flight with ba to travel from gibraltar to london heathrow on may 10, 2023. my flight was scheduled to leave at 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon. i had originally planned on leaving my luggage at heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousin's place. en route to gib airport a few hours prior to departure, i checked my flight details and found out that my flight had been cancelled. i had a connecting flight booked with westjet from london heathrow to vancouver the following day and i had to make that flight, so it was imperative that i got to london. i checked the ba website and couldn't find any other flights with them that would work, so unfortunately i made the mistake of requesting a refund. i managed to find a flight out of malaga that got me into london just after 10:00 p.m. so i booked that and then called british airways as i wanted to discuss compensation. that's when they advised me that because i had requested a refund (they used the phrase ""abandoned"" travel with them), they were not prepared to do anything for me. apparently, i should have called them first, and then they would have made the arrangements. of course they don't explain that on their website - they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed. and even when i plead my case with the agent at malaga airport and then followed up with customer relations several times via email, they flat out refused to budge. i had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used avios to cover the cost of my checked baggage, so in other words no out of pocket costs for the trip. once this incident happened, i ended up spending 660 euros in airfare and checked baggage charges to get to london from malaga (i.e., different airport than the one i had originally booked from). and because the luggage storage facility at heathrow had closed by the time i eventually arrived, i ended up booking a night at a hotel since i couldn't travel by train to my cousin's place any longer (3 bags in tow) and i didn't want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me up. this cost me another £125 in room and meal costs. all ba ended up doing to compensate me was to give me 5,000 free avios - a mere pittance compared to my out of pocket expenses. despite trying to explain to them why i requested the refund instead of calling them first, they wouldn't budge. very easy for them to say what i should have done since they work there and know the rules and they weren't the ones scrambling to find alternative travel arrangements within a few hours. i pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customers to call them when this situation happens, and that way they would never encounter this problem. my feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake i did so they can then wash their hands of the situation and ultimately save money. i've been an executive club member for years and they simply didn't care. they said there was nothing they could do. i'm sure if one of the ba executive's friends or family members had gone through this, staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right. i used to be a fan of ba but they have really gone downhill in my opinion. once i used up my remaining avios and travel credit, i will cancel my executive club membership and never fly with them again.",29th July 2023,Canada,Economy Class,no,5,Denver to Heathrow,Family Leisure,Yes,Neutral

"i chose british airways especially because i was going to travel with my niece and nephew, and wanted everything to work well. what a disaster! first, it took me two hours to do the check-in online due to a technical problem. i also had to spend more than 20 minutes in a call to a uk number from my spanish cell phone because that’s the only service they provide on weekends. then, at the airport, when there was the boarding time, we had to wait with the rest of the people for almost two hours standing on the line without knowing what was going on. they just told us to wait. finally we could access the plane. after 40 minutes inside, they told us to leave the plane again and told us the flight had been cancelled. we had to take our luggage and queue again for a couple of hours. then, do the check in again and wait for another flight to take off, which was again delayed! we spent almost 12 hours at the airport. no information was provided, no solutions were offered. we had to seat in the last raw (when i had paid to seat on the first half of the plane). no money was refunded no apologizes or compensation was given. i also had pre-purchased food and they couldn’t provide the service. all in all, terrible. never again!",25th July 2023,Spain,Economy Class,no,1,London to Sydney,Couple Leisure,Yes,Negative
"a simple story with an unfortunate outcome that really could happen to anyone. my partner and i recently started working after studying purchased two tickets to travel from london city airport to frankfurt. when we purchased the tickets, i mistakenly entered my name twice (e.g. mr john smith and ms john smith). little did we know that our 1 simple mistake would cost us over 300 pounds. upon arriving at the airport we were told there was no way to change the name (apparently they can only change 3 letters where there has been a typo?) and i had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if i wanted to board the flight - the price: almost seven times (!) higher than my original ticket. zero empathy was shown. zero alternative was offered. trusting ba's staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket. immediately after i purchased the ticket i contacted ba's 'commercial change booking team' and informed them of our situation. the service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee. he offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then, advising me that i had a claim to the difference and i should contact customer support to do so. i told this person several times i wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer, i would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket. he said no, i could claim the difference. fair enough - we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with customer support for the difference. two days later, british airways customer response informed us that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had 'voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight'. they've continued to send generic emails until this week, when they just stopped responding. so in short, british airways misled and deceived my partner into accepting a lowball offer to waive our right to claim a refund. it keeps me up at night thinking how they can do this and get away with it so easily.",21st July 2023,Germany,Economy Class,no,7,BLR to LHR,Business,Yes,Neutral
"flight was delayed due to the inbound flight arriving late. there was no announcement to inform of the delay nor were the sceens updated. when ready to board we were requested to take our seats quickly to help reduce the delay, which people did. the pilot then announced he had received the documents for the wrong flight from ground staff, so we had to wait while they returned to get the right paperwork. after this was resolved, the pilot announced there would be a delay as there was only two push back tractors and we had to wait again. so after rushing to sit quickly, we sat the the aircraft at the gate for nearly one hour, which is longer than the flight takes ! of course ams is not bas home base and it uses contracted staff here, but it should require a better level of service, it was embarrassing hearing the pilot apologise at every step of the way. it’ll be eurostar for me next time.",21st July 2023,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,3,Heathrow to Las Vegas,Family Leisure,Yes,Neutral
"i don't understand why british airways is classified as a 4 star airline? the service is really mediocre. the food is untasty and insufficient for a long haul trip. some members of the cabin crew are friendly but they are not attentive enough and create a very basic experience. this really is all about getting from point a to b without what it used to be an enjoyable trip making experience. the inflight entertainment is fairly good, but you do need to bring your own water not to get dehydrated, some snacks and ideally food and perhaps smile to yourself as otherwise you are faced with just a cold, personality less experience.",20th July 2023,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,3,Gatwick to Venice,Solo Leisure,Yes,Positive

"my family and i have flown mostly on british airways for the last 30 years. i am a priority passenger and fly often enough to recognise cabin crew and know some by name. they used to be a really good airline to fly with. things have really deteriorated with their face to face customer care since the pandemic. the aircraft look worn. for example, on my flight back my audiovisual equipment did not work and had to be reset twice, finally working in the last hour before we landed. the second time around, i think the reset was done for the whole aircraft. the touch screen function on my screen did not work. the usb charger ports on my seat did not work. the staff were pleasant enough, but their service oozed mediocrity.  there did not seem to be much pride in what they were doing. the food has been the worst part on our ba flights since the pandemic. they gave us a menu, asked what we’d like, did a check and then told us that it was not available as they had run out and would we like to choose something else. they then told us that we’d get first choice at the second service which they couldn’t deliver on. finally after choosing and getting whatever it is that we did, the food was tasteless. we take part in post flight surveys regularly and have stated all of this, to no avail. as a family of 3, we fly british airways medium to long haul regularly, possibly 4-6 times a year each. for us, the good things about flying ba are that we are priority customers, usually have a direct flight to our destinations and get good service on the ground, when checking in and in the lounges when we use them.",9th July 2023,United Kingdom,Premium Economy,no,1,LHR to CPT,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive
"this has been by far the worst service i have had on a plane. it's very obvious that if you are flying economy and not a frequent traveler of british airways, they care very little about you. we had to wait an hour for them to even open the check-in. once they did, they had 5 lines and only one that serviced economy. even though the line for economy was three times the length of the premium classes. then they told economy passengers that all bags had to be check and no carryon due to a full flight and no room in the overhead compartments. once we arrived at the gate, there were not enough seats to fit everyone and you couldn't leave the boarding area. i will never fly this airline again!",9th July 2023,United States,Economy Class,no,9,BLR to LHR,Business,Yes,Neutral

"24 hours before our departure on ba059 to cape town from heathrow on thursday 29th june, we did an online check-in. seats had already been allocated for my wife and i - 41 e and f - which are the middle two seats of the central block of four. these were totally unsuitable for us as we are in our late 70's and getting in and out of seats to stretch our legs or go the the toilet would mean climbing over a person on the aisle. but there were no other seats available. we got to heathrow about 6 hours before departure and tried to change seats at check-in, to no avail, although the lady was very sympathetic and tried her utmost. she did offer us an upgrade to premium economy but at 450gbp each it was beyond our affordability. she said we should try again at the departure gate but that also failed. we spoke to a member of the flight crew who was totally unsympathetic. the economy seats are so tiny that i was jammed shoulder to shoulder between by wife and a stranger, with knees touching the seat pocket in front. for 12 hours we suffered. when we did manage to get out of our seat due to the kindness of the young lady next to me on the aisle, it was a mission trying to clamber past the reclined backrest in front of me. ba economy is absolutely awful. the evening meal was near-inedible - both choices were spicy foods which are not very suitable when flying, especially for an older person. the breakfast spanish omelette was, however, not bad at all. the previous day we had flown economy from malta to heathrow on malta airlines and that 3 hour trip was a pleasure. the seats are wide and there is ample legroom. if they can do it, then why not british airways.",5th July 2023,South Africa,Economy Class,no,5,Gatwick to Venice,Solo Leisure,Yes,Neutral

"my flight on on 12 may 2023 got delayed an hour and 25 minutes which resulted in the cancellation of our connection flight on 12 may 2023 as the arrival of the first flight was only 15 before the departure of the second connecting flight. we contacted the ba call center multiple times to make changes to the flight in order to still arrive on the 12th of may to kef airport through different flights. the team tried to find a solution but none made sense, not even on the next day the 13th of may 2023. we have made full booking of accommodation, car rental, activities etc for the vacation in iceland. the cancellation of of these booking is not refundable. the call center suggested that we cancel the flight for a full refund, then claim compensation for the delay and difference in airfare cost and other non refundable bookings due to the delay and cancellation of our flight. british airways responded to the claim after a month with no compensation at all, even though we paid additional $600 on new bookings and additional charges. the refund of the cancelled flight took more than a month with multiple calla to follow up almost every week. i was promised to get refund on the first call but later i found out it was not processed properly. every-time i call the agent ask questions about why flight was canceled etc which is annoying when my understanding everything was under process for payment. after multiple calls i was refunded partially and not the full amount which is even bizarre from a company of this level. i had to make more calls to get the remaining balance refunded. the whole experience was terrible.",29th June 2023,United Arab Emirates,Economy Class,no,3,LHR to CPT,Couple Leisure,Yes,Negative

"this is a two-for-one review covering economy and business class on the ba flight from london city to ibiza. economy was excellent. a very light lunch (small cheese-and-pastrami sandwich, chocolate brownie) followed by a pretty much free-flowing drinks trolley. the flight was full but the crew worked hard and did a very good job. this is a flight i would recommend. except, don't fall for the last minute offer for an upgrade to business for £100+ in each direction, as i did. (i flew economy out and business back, while my brother flew business, then economy.) the business seats are identical to economy, with no seats blocked, so you are squished in four abreast. the meals are almost identical, with minor tweaks such as a yoghurt for your £100. the only real plus is champagne. but on my flight, there was none because of ""supply issues"". the cabin attendant (i think his name was tom) must be one of the best in the business. i didn't eat, so i paid £100 for nothing. oh well. so great flight but stick with economy.",24th June 2023,United Kingdom,Business Class,yes,5,London to Tampa,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

"i booked our first out of country trip to take my husband on a surprise trip to monaco. i gave us over 3 hours for our connecting flight to and from home through heathrow. our flight left seattle an hour late causing us to miss our connecting flight. we were rescheduled before we even landed. they booked us on a flight 7 hours later and offered no food tickets or any other type of reimbursement. additionally we sat in their customer service line for an hour and a half to see if they could rebook us on an earlier flight, to watch them continually assist other customers that walked up outside of the queue (no earlier flights were available). when we arrived in nice, france the airport was closed, including the rental car desk. we were not offered any assistance from the airline on a room or other accommodation for the night. we found a cab, which cost us 85 euros one one to get to our hotel. we thought there is no way something like this could happen on the way home….we were wrong. our flight from nice to heathrow was 30 minutes late, with a 2.5 hour layover you would think we should still make our flight, unfortunately long security lines caused over 1.5 hr further delay. when arriving ba closed the doors and said they could not hold the plane any longer despite arriving 15mins before departure. after running through the heathrow airport and going through security again. they sent us back to the customer service queue, where the first statement was we can’t get you out until tomorrow. after begging they found us a flight on another airline. at that time we were told our bags were transferred to our flight with delta. we were given 8 pounds each for snacks at the airport for our now additional 5 hour delay. in total for our trip there and home we spent 13 hours at heathrow airport which our original total layover of 6 hours, and we were offered 8 pound each. unfortunately the drama continues. the two bags that they said made the delta flight, shockingly did not. we were told that we had the file the claim with delta, since the last part of our flight was with them. we have now been home for 5 days and each airline is pointing the finger at the other. as i said to both of them today. i don’t care who’ has my bags figure it out and send me my luggage i don't want your $500 reimbursement per bag, as that doesn’t come close to the memories and stuff that i have in there. i will never fly british airways again, and delta’s baggage people are not doing great either.",8th June 2023,United States,Economy Class,no,3,BLR to LHR,Business,Yes,Neutral

"i will never travel with british airways again. i spent over $10,000 on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the uk. first, the boeing 787-9 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy. the seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half. they have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet, which wakes up that passenger. the whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you. second, the food was disgusting. third, the service terrible. fourth, the toilet was tiny. fifth, the inflight screen was fixed and too high so i could not see anything. sixth, their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and i had to pay more (no free airport transfers with british airways). seventh, the charging points did not work. the second leg to london was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle. that was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece. this means that you are sleeping on a metal bar (the seat) where there is a gap in the seat. to add insult to injury i now find that both flights back to sydney are on the small plane. to book a seat before check in is $170. i paid it but note that there were only 4 seats left. this is why i got the worst seat in the house going out. this is the most appalling airline service i have ever encountered. there is no point paying for business class in british airways.",8th May 2023,Australia,Business Class,no,7,BKK to LHR,Business,Yes,Negative

worst experience of my life trying to deal with the customer service for british airways. so many issues with getting from one destination to the other. had an absolutely horrible time trying to get answers or reach anyone who was capable of helping navigate uncertainties. i wrote them a formal complaint requesting some type of refund and received a generic “we are sorry” email with 5000 avios attached which is equivalent to maybe $50 on a $600+ flight. needless to say these will go to waste as i refuse to fly with an untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline that couldn’t even address one single issue expressed to them. it was equivalent to handing me a band aid after slapping me in the face. i will say the flight itself was smooth and the onboard staff was kind and attentive. the most frustrating thing is that the customer service is trained to give you the runaround so heavily to the point of exhaustion that you just give up trying and take the loss.,17th April 2023,United States,Economy Class,no,3,London to Sydney,Couple Leisure,Yes,Negative
"due to code sharing with cathay pacific i was downgraded to ba on my return leg. i can’t describe how cheated i felt. i booked and paid for an airline with great entertainment, food and service, instead, i was forced to go hungry because they only had one choice of meal and it was inedible. to ensure the passengers didn’t get any funny ideas and assume that as the vegetarian option was unavailable they might be given a cracker or a small packet of nuts. the cabin crew announced in their uniquely aggressive and dismissive way “you won’t get anything else for 12 hours you know!” the entertainment is compiled mainly of b movies so i paid £11 for wi-fi so i could watch netflix on my laptop. unsurprisingly, the signal was so weak i couldn’t even send an email. to add insult to injury, the earbuds provided the cheapest and lowest quality i have ever seen. since the last time i used this airline the crew are less rude and obnoxious and are now just impatient and unhelpful.  what i don’t understand is why it seems that british airways look for these characteristics as desirable attributes for their crew.",17th April 2023,Hong Kong,Economy Class,no,5,LHR to CPT,Couple Leisure,Yes,Negative
"lhr check in was quick at the first wing and quickly through security. the first lounge was quiet for a change and a reasonably good breakfast buffet available. while ba have brought back their highlife magazine in the lounge, it seems they used covid to scrap all the other magazines they used to offer, as part of the endless ba cost cutting. the toilets in the lounge were as disgusting as ever, not cleaned frequently on this visit and they are about 20 years out of date (the public washrooms in t5 are better and cleaner). boarding was the usual ba muddled mess, and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doing. endless announcements at the gate about being a full flight, requesting passengers to check in bags, only to get on a flight that was less than 40% full. onboard a very good welcome from captain and the flight left the gate only 5 mins late. breakfast had 3 choices and was a fair standard. no hot towels or even packet towels offered in club europe any more, another part of the relentless ba cost cutting. i wouldn't mind but fares are proportionately a lot higher now than pre covid. cabin staff service was perfunctory at best, not a scrap of recognition for ba gold or oneworld emerald members, clear proof that ba really don't care any more. breakfast trays cleared 45 mins into the flight, and that was the sign for staff to stay in the front galley for the rest of the flight. paid £4.99 for 1 hours wifi, and dropped connection for the next 40 mins. sad to note that staff service on ryanair is more pro active nowadays. priority tagged suitcase came out nearly last at malaga, this is standard for ba business class baggage handling. do not waste your money on club europe, standards just keep dropping.",16th April 2023,United Kingdom,Business Class,no,3,BLR to LHR,Business,Yes,Positive

"our flight out to dubrovnik was at the painful time of 6:30 in the morning and from london gatwick, not an easy airport to get to at that hour especially as you have to be at the airport minimum 2hrs before to be ready to board. i understand why the likes of easyjet, ryanair or wizzair fly at very odd times to utilise cheaper slots at airports, but it seems an odd choice for ba given most people like us who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alone. outbound lgw-dbv: boarding was fairly quick, easy and efficient and we took off on time. pilot announcements clear, professional and inspired confidence which is something i appreciate and expect of ba pilots. aircraft was clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the 'pinnacle' seats in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrests for better comfort. complimentary harrogate mineral water given as usual which is a premium touch, complimentary snack of a nutrigain bar was poor and not premium however. cabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour - messy ill-fitting uniforms and unclassy make-up. toilets clean and maintained, appreciate anti-bacterial wipes being kept available post-covid. inbound dbv-lgw: for some reason no online or app check-in available, despite dubrovnik airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilities. no queue at manual check-in though, and ground staff were very warm, friendly and helpful. pro-actively offered to take our larger hand-luggage into hold free of charge, but we decided to keep with us as we would have to dash for train home from airport and trains on the other end were being cancelled already. we did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time. also we travelled to dubrovnik out of season, and the airport was empty at that hour, with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening. all the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this flight. we boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for 15 minutes for no reason. it's truly bizarre how ba managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off. pilots for this flight were unpolished, with unclear announcements - during the flight one couldn't even remember where we flying back to! no apology for delay. cabin crew a bit smarter presented and seemed more approachable. harrogate water given out and the worlds tiniest bag of pretzels complimentary. seats for this flight were horrendous and the new 'slimline' ones ba are installing from row 14 onwards. these seats have barely any padding, so very hard and also have no headrests so very hard to get comfortable. we landed 55 minutes late in gatwick and again no apology was given - we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise we'd been stranded for hours. we'd spent half an hour circling gatwick because we missed our original landing slot. given 7 because in the context of the short-haul market thats what they deserve - we fly ba as we don't fly the low-cost carriers after so many bad experiences, but it's by no measure good, just the least bad option. given 1 point extra solely for giving something complimentary onboard.",15th March 2023,United Kingdom,Economy Class,yes,9,LHR to CPT,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

"the usual shambolic unfolding that ba has now unfortunately been come to known for. we had a long weekend flight booked to munich that was supposed to be departing on 9th february at 19:55. this happened to be our first flight with our newborn (3 month old) daughter. it turned out to be a horror show of incompetence. just under 3hrs before scheduled departure, the original 9th february flight was cancelled. we received an email as we were boarding the heathrow express. i’d booked a day of holiday off work for this trip. we ended up getting doing a round trip to paddington instead. on the way back from the cancelled flight, both me and my wife tried calling ba. despite one of us having silver membership (possibly the largest joke of a membership currently out there), i took us nearly 45 minutes to speak to someone who could help. i believe ba outsource their call centres and so you end up talking to people who are following a script. the result is that you might as well be speaking to an ai rather than a human. we often received the response similar to ‘computer says no’. if this is the service level for silver members i can’t imagine what a regular punter has to put up with. when the phone originally connected to a person, i had to wait 5 minutes as his computer booted up. - ba then proceeded to auto-book us onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destination. our original flight was to munich and the auto-booked replacement flight was to salzburg. when asking the robot at the ba call centre why they booked us on a replacement flight to a location 135km apart, they couldn’t understand my frustration.  eventually, someone was able to book us onto a flight the following day at 17:00. not ideal as i’d wasted a valuable day off work and the hotel wouldn’t refund us or move our booking, but at least we were going to munich and not salzburg. - the day of the new flight came round and, this time, we managed to get all the way to the check in desk. upon arriving at the check in desk, we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled 4 minutes earlier. no email. no text. no notification ever arrived from ba to tell us that the flight had been cancelled. incomprehensible as to how this could have possibly happened. the check in person said i should get on the app to rebook. at this point, i didn’t know whether to explode with anger or cry. luckily, another check in person had an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook us. we were booked onto another flight later that evening (19:55 - ba0958). unfortunately, that meant 5hrs in the grotty lounge with a 3 month old baby. it appears that everyone now has access to a lounge and so there’s really no difference between the lounge and a hostel, other than you get free stuff in the former. this was not a pleasant experience. we did eventually arrive in munich and, despite asking, didn’t get our push chair/stroller delivered to the front of the plane. the plane was a characteristically ba dumping ground - they used to give you sanitising wipes so you could clean your seat and tray table down but they seemed to have cut back on this service too. all in all, another shocking ba service. a lost day of holiday and not an an ounce of empathy/sympathy/understanding at all from any of the employees i interacted with.",12th March 2023,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,3,London to Luanda,Couple Leisure,Yes,Negative

"my review relates to the appalling experiences i had with british airways on 14th february 2023. i was due to travel to madrid with british airways and before setting off i heard on the radio that there were flight delays. i looked at the heathrow airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelled. as a result of the information on the website, i called british airways and have 26 minutes on hold i found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre in south africa. the person was hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he was incompetent and insisted that the flight was not cancelled. i made my way to heathrow and sure enough the flight was indeed cancelled. the woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that “there are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you”. she refused to let me and about 12 other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk. the same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to “go online to rebook your seat”. i am visually impaired and found the attitude of the ba employee to be appalling. i called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again in a long queue to a call centre. the person who picked up the phone kept me waiting 22 minutes and declared that the flight was not cancelled and that the airport “must be wrong”. he then in a flippant tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that i would have to go and speak to iberia customer services in heathrow to rebook! i took the elderly gentleman with me to iberia where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with iberia. i returned to ba and this time i joined the check-in line and told a check-in agent what had happened. the man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minutes. he gave me a £30 voucher as a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline. the voucher proved useless i am afraid as various shops in the predepature area refused to accept it and although i was told i could use it after clearing security none of the shops would accept it. once aboard my new flight the service was minimal. other than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzels nothing else was available. this was a full flight as so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flight. ba cabin crew announced that any additional items other than the small bottle of water and pretzels had to be ordered via their skyshop.",18th February 2023,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,3,Gatwick to Venice,Solo Leisure,Yes,Negative

"outward journey ba245 london to buenos aires club world 10 january 2023. our experience was poor from beginning to end. although we had reserved seats 11f and 12j, another passenger was occupying 11f and crew made no attempt to address the problem. eventually, i persuaded the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat 11d. we boarded punctually but were not offered drinks. when i asked for a drink, the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problem. the same crew member then began taking orders for dinner but did not write them all down and gave up after a few minutes for the safety briefing. she asked us to repeat our orders later. the hot flannels smelled musty and felt old and ragged.  one of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and i were related.  my soup was cold, i was told it was served from flasks. was that an explanation or an excuse? my coffee was weak and tasted like instant granules. my companion was initially served no bread roll with dinner. the breakfast menu stated a 'selection of rolls/pastries' but there was no choice and my companion was given a dried fruit pastry, where he would have chosen a bread roll.  although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat, small bottles of water ran out. return journey ba244 buenos aires to london heathrow world traveller plus 26 january 2023 was a huge contrast, from the warm welcome on boarding to crew’s professionalism throughout. it’s a poor reflection on club world service that our experience in world traveller plus was so much better and kinder. weighed against the advantages of a flat bed, the considerable price difference was not worth paying for the catalogue of errors and inconveniences outlined above.",31st January 2023,United Kingdom,Premium Economy,no,3,BLR to LHR,Business,Yes,Neutral

"probably the worst business class experience i've ever had on an airline. just a few of the issues: required to purchase seats on international (club world) business class. this was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional $600 on a single leg (lhr-lax) for a family of four. given the very strange business class seating layout on ba a380s, leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family. ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft. on my vie-lhr leg, the boarding time for the a320 was over 50 minutes long, leading to a delayed departure. there was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times. severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite c of terminal 5 at heathrow. boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding (i have no idea why not) and so crowding was extreme. the overall boarding area was far too small for an a380, and i believe this satellite was designed and built after the first a380s were delivered. online check-in in advance of flights appears to be completely broken. i was urged repeatedly (on the ba website, and via email and text) to ""upload my covid documents"" even though, at the end of 2022, there are no covid documents required for travel. after i filled in basic contact information on the website - and did not upload any ""covid documentation"" - i was informed (several hours later) that my ""covid documents have been verified"". i then received another text message urging me to ""upload my covid documentation"". on the vie-lhr leg, the shop.ba.com page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times - over six hours, and then four hours just before landing. ba lounges for club europe and club world at heathrow are often seriously overcrowded. furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty. that said, the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality. the food quality in ba lounges at heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline. onboard, food and beverage service was far below average for international business class. terrible, one might say. on the lhr-lax leg, there was no pre-meal beverage service and there were no mid-flight beverage services at all. unlike most business class offerings on other airlines, there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight. meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off, with the ""chicken or fish?"" type of meal selection similar to economy class. there was no coffee or tea service after meals. food quality was poor, with the pre-landing snack of a ""ploughman's lunch"" being downright disgusting. . there was no beverage or bar set-up in the galley areas - beverages available to passengers during the flight - as is standard on most international business class offerings. even bottles of water seemed be hidden away, requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water. i won't comment on the bizarre seating layout on the a380, as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating. the seats are not 6' 2"" long as stated on the ba website, and i found the seats too short for my 6' 2"" height. the ""priority"" luggage tags were not followed in the baggage delivery.",2nd January 2023,United States,Business Class,no,5,BKK to LHR,Business,Yes,Negative

"just a few years ago flying on ba was enjoyable, but times have changed. these days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all. the terminal 5 experience still feels classy, and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient. on board though, it’s just become an experience to be endured. ba’s mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane, and nastier for the rest underlines this. there is no entertainment, no magazine. refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app. there is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day, despite the competition being able to do this. is it too much to ask for, when trapped on board for five hours? you get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar. on the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing, but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves. recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed. on the return flight, for one reason or another due to ba’s delays from the previous day, we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldn’t travel at all because there were not enough crew. the cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight. altogether, i would say good things if there were any - but it’s hard to think of anything i could recommend ba for; and that is a pity, because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making european journeys.",25th October 2022,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,7,London to Sydney,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

"my wife and i booked a flight in april 2022 that included a return trip from edinburgh thru london to washington. when we checked in at edinburgh airport 3 hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight. we asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in on-line (which we hadn’t done).  we were instructed to come back in 2 hrs and 15 mins, still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security, to see if we could get on the flight via standby. we waited and then finally at 1:15 pm, 45 mins before our scheduled 2:00 pm flight, we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to london but no boarding passes for the connecting flight (1:55 mins after arrival time). our luggage was not checked thru to washington but only to london. we were told we’d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us. when we got to security check area the line was massively long. we questioned a ba staff member who said we had to get in line like the others. we decided to pay (12 pounds) to go through “fast track” security to make our flight. we got to the gate in time. yet, due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggage-space issues on the plane, our flight arrived in london 45 mns late, and after going to the “flight connections” we were told 25 mins before the scheduled departure, with a vague explanation of “there isn’t enough time,” that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight. we were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the check-in area to be rebooked for a later flight. when we got to the check-in counter area a ba staff person, standing at entrance to the check-in line, advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in 3 hrs. when we finally got thru on the phone, we were informed that the best ba could do for us was to get us on a flight 5 days later, and then not to our original destination (iad), but to baltimore. i was not told or assured i’d be compensated for this extreme expense of staying 5 more days in a hotel - just that i could go to the ba website and make a claim on-line. this ugly experience, still ongoing, has ruined our trip to the uk.",22nd July 2022,United States,Economy Class,no,7,Rome to Heathrow,Solo Leisure,Yes,Neutral
"three flights, london to reykjavik return and frankfurt to london. generally the flights were of an acceptable standard, though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a three-hour flight. the cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly. a big plus for ba was informative announcements from the cockpit, often missing on other airlines. flights operated generally close to the advertised times. but ba was let down by chaotic check-in and boarding procedures. in preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in business class passengers). why are economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back? this was standard across the three flights, but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their (enormous) cabin baggage. it would make much more sense to board people at the back first. and to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last. the small bottle of water and a half-full bag of crisps offered as a snack on a three-hour flight to iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what air france offered on a subsequent short flight to paris. at reykjavik there was no departure lounge next to the gate -- passengers had to queue wherever they could in the corridor.",18th July 2022,Australia,Economy Class,yes,3,Denver to Heathrow,Family Leisure,Yes,Negative

"boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack air-con at the gate. the club suite cabins were about 3/4 full, but the rest of the plane can't have been much more than 20% occupancy. whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say, but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins. despite that, the drink and food service in business was efficient, and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after take-off, which is a real bonus on a night-time flight. however, the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible. the club suite is a big improvement on the ancient cw product, although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two. one definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old cw. the large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole ife system was much more responsive. the new seats don't significantly aid sleeping, particularly as there's an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine. waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets. performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of schedule. progress through border control was speedy but baggage collection was delayed for unspecified reasons. overall, a good flight.",25th January 2022,United Kingdom,Business Class,yes,3,BLR to LHR,Business,Yes,Positive

"return trip cape town to durban in club class highlighted the inconsistency. our outbound trip in december was good in all respects, whereas the return trip was disappointing. check in was fine, apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority, resulting in a long wait for our third bag. the lounge was busy, but no complaints. we went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen, where there was no sign of activity, although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time. shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates. the informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate. i checked on the flight radar app, which showed that our aircraft had started in durban, and flown to cape town, port elizabeth, back to cape town, and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight. in fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late. boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430, 60 minutes late. drinks service only started 30 minutes later, followed by lunch. the food was good but the wine offering very mediocre, and not up to club standards. with the price of good wines in south africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine. lunch service was quick, but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested. overall this was a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crew",12th January 2022,South Africa,Business Class,yes,3,London to Luanda,Couple Leisure,Yes,Negative

"overall, a very lovely flight with ba to edinburgh during christmas holidays. lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when i travelled last time). although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23c) and had a funky lighting. although seats are the same as those in economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at air france) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for gold card passengers, ba automatically reserves row 1 in club europe with enhanced legroom which i think is a great touch). the crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. i am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. for a quick hop, ba ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a cdg-lhr leg air france presented a ‘chic’ cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / klm served a super nice and simple chicken caesar but it was in a paper box). one big drawback was the first wing experience at t5: the queue there was so long that i decided to go through the regular lines instead. it’s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a gold status. nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. the flight was £200 one way (£600 return incl. transfer to kirkwall) which was pretty expensive, however, the service seemed like it was worth the money.",28th December 2021,United Kingdom,Business Class,yes,3,Denver to Heathrow,Family Leisure,Yes,Positive

an ordinary ba domestic shuttle flight from belfast to london heathrow. usually uneventful except for the cabin crew announcement three times advising people complete a uk passenger arrival form from the gov.uk website or risk prosecution. some people challenged this statement and were rebuked. ba cabin crew were adamant that this was now a requirement. but the regular traveller amongst us knew this was incorrect advice. some people were anxious departing the aircraft. other than that crisp snacks and water were offered which is a nice touch. sky cafe still not on sale - not quite sure why given covid protocols in the uk are mainly relaxed now. ba is still by far the best operator from ulster to england.,3rd October 2021,United Kingdom,Economy Class,yes,3,LHR to CPT,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

"i think british airways needs to be much clearer about what their covid-19 ""travel flexibility"" really means, because it doesn't pass the common-sense test: i purchased a round-trip business class ticket from new york to-and-from mykonos through london. i traveled there with no problem. the day before my return to new york, though, i took my covid-19 test and learned that i tested positive. i tried to call the airline on the many usless numbers they provide on their website. the recorded message drones on and on about how they have no one to answer the phone because of covid safety and simply says ""therefore we can't answer your call; try again."" no ability to leave a call-back number or a voicemail, etc. for whatever reason the ba website thought that i had bought the ticket through a third-party agent (i did not - i bought it on ba.com) and so wouldnt let me cancel or reschedule the flight on the web site. i called and called over the coming days and could not get through to the london, athens or new york lines. two days later after having 2 negative pcr tests (the most accurate test), i learned i was not positive and so had to buy a new $5000 return flight to the u.s. i've now been calling the ba usa customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day, never to get through. finally did and have been told that the fact that i couldnt get on the flight because of a covid scare counts for nothing. the fact they dont have enough people answering the phone counts for nothing. or that i was unable to change the flight to a few days later on the web site becuase the ticket was mis-booked. they have offered that if i send them a greek doctor's note saying that i was sick, then they'll give me a voucher for a future flight from mykonos to new york. i am speechless at the stupidity of this whole situation.",9th September 2021,United States,Business Class,no,9,London to Sydney,Couple Leisure,Yes,Negative

i flew on british airways cheapest fare which was a hand baggage only fare in economy class. despite this being the cheapest fare you can actually carry two pieces of cabin luggage both weighing up to 23kg each. the value for money here is incredible. the ground staff at london heathrow are very polite and helpful. the plane was clean and the cabin crew were very smiley and polite. this was a short haul flight but we were given a free packet of crisps and a bottle of water. there was wifi onboard which we paid £11.99 for the full flight access package and it was great. it was fast enough to stream a movie on netflix. if you are considering between a low cost carrier and a premium carrier like ba pay the extra and fly with the premium carrier. with the generous cabin luggage allowance and the free snacks on board it may end up being cheaper and nobody claps when the plane lands.,22nd August 2021,United Kingdom,Economy Class,yes,3,Gatwick to Venice,Solo Leisure,Yes,Positive

"i’ve been flying with ba for years and never had any issues. i recently had to arrange to have surgery in budapest and naturally wanted to fly ba. so i booked my flights from bhd to bud via lhr online on their site. once booked i informed the hospital and confirmed my appointment. the very next day i received an email from ba telling me they had cancelled my flight to bud but not to worry as they had moved me to an earlier (a much earlier) flight the same day. only problem was this earlier flight departed around two hours before my flight from bhd arrived. i would have thought that this would have flashed up on their system as being an issue, but seemingly not… *interlude* to get into hungary during covid one needs a valid reason, with medical treatment being one. i had to fill in a very confusing form on the hungarian police website that was a confusing mix of hungarian and pidgin english. anyway form filled in with flight numbers etc, emailed to the authorities there and exemption granted. so i took the earlier flight but this meant i had to fly into london the previous evening and stay overnight in a hotel. so operation booked, hotel booked, airport transfers booked immigration papers amended and re sent and admiration granted and flights re booked, what could go wrong? around three weeks before i was due to travel, ba, rather unsportingly, decided to cancel my flight to bud again. needless to say i was furious. i complained to ba customer services and was given a stock excuse about covid disrupting air travel. great excuse, only having looked at bud arrivals info, ryanair had been flying there once daily for at least the preceding several months. so ba’s covid excuse rang somewhat hollow. epilogue: i got refunded most of my money from the flights i booked with ba, although they refused to refund my bhd - lhr flights because who knows? i also lost the money i had spent on a hotel and half of the money i had spent on booking airport transfers. given the cavalier attitude ba seem to have to bookings and their indifference to ruining weeks of preparation on my part and the fact that i lost a not inconsiderable sum of money, i’ve decided to avoid ba from now on.",22nd July 2021,United Kingdom,Premium Economy,no,9,LHR to CPT,Couple Leisure,Yes,Negative

"i usually avoid ba because of its appalling customer service and sneaky extra charges, but this flight was my only option. note that ba actually charges for seat pre-selection in biz class -- 100 uk pounds in this case! does any other airline in the world dare do that? i saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free. the seats were ba's universally derided, cramped 6-across back-to-front configuration, where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arm's length away. no other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement --- i wonder why? no preflight drink was offered. at meal time i selected one of the three main offerings, only to be told it wasn't available -- even though there were only 3 people in my 16 seat biz section. the seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position. the ""bed"" is the narrowest i have experienced in biz class, and is also very hard. the cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin; i had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm. the amenity kit is the smallest i've ever seen in biz class -- it fits in the palm of the hand. all in all, this uncomfortable, miserly experience is hardly worth the £5,727 that ba charges for this route. i used miles to pay for my ticket -- but of course got whacked with ba's unique and notorious ""fuel surcharge"" fee of $636 for using miles.",22nd June 2021,United States,Business Class,no,5,Denver to Heathrow,Family Leisure,Yes,Negative

(i’m not sure is it connected to ba, but still, i want to mention this). the crew was very helpful and extremely understanding, very professional and urgent to help, they have been a great help and i am very gracious for this. i want to separately point out one employee - shanell (if i am not mistaken, who works at collision testing center in heathrow terminal 5). she is a savior and most importantly a human, which is very rare nowadays! carrying on, i went to ba check-in, but unfortunately couldn’t do it, as my results didn’t go through yet. however, another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive. i’ve come to her 3 times with additional questions, and every time she was very patient, professional, and happy to help. after i got my results i came back to heathrow on 24th, but unfortunately, there were no flights to cairo, the situation became even more complicated (i will spare the details). however, here again, brilliant employees of ba offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me. the nicest lady i’ve ever met, unfortunately, i didn’t catch her name, but i am aware it was her first day at ba and that she is egyptian, followed me throughout my struggles, offered me emotional and professional support. she tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did. she was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which i can’t thank her enough. she also asked her colleague to help me, which he kindly did.  lastly, the nice lady (shame i don’t know her name) also shared my struggles with her colleague mani who came to substitute her on the position. he was very friendly and attentive as well, talked me through the process, offered different ways i can stay at the airport, gave his phone to call, and offered to drop me off at the hotel, which he did not have to do whatsoever. to conclude, i merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time, as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects, i honestly do not know what would i do if i haven’t met them. i don’t know was i just lucky to meet these people or all ba employees are of the same morality, but i do want to thank ba for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines! for some people, the help that was provided to me might seem like a normal thing to do. however, for me, it was a pleasant and so much needed surprise. as no one in",25th December 2020,United Kingdom,Economy Class,yes,3,Gatwick to Venice,Solo Leisure,Yes,Positive

"just before the borders were closed in south africa due to corona virus, i went to the airport to find out if the flight scheduled will fly as planned, there was no international flight customer service staff available so i was not able to get a response, the only number available was a uk number which will cost me more than a flight to enquire. next day i managed to get on board the flight. sadly due to my fault, i forgot my laptop inside the aircraft on arrival to terminal 5. i was one of the last passengers to leave the plane. i realised my mistake after i passed security and i was not allowed back into the airport to collect my laptop which is fair enough and i understand why i could not go back to the aircraft. they gave me a number to call and i have been calling the number since march, so far it has been zero positive response because they are using a third party company to help you which has zero interest to help you find your lost items. basically ba does not have means in place for passengers to find their items. my laptop was left inside the flight hence it is impossible for crew staff and cleaning staff to not find it hence i just can not understand how they can not find it bearing in mind it was 100% left inside the plane. lessons learned, avoid if you can.",11th April 2020,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,9,London to Luanda,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

"san diego to stockholm via london. had i written this review immediately on landing it would have been zero out of ten. but i realise this would be unfair- ba is a game of two halves. the inflight experience is immeasurably improved from a few years ago. the food in club is excellent, the cabin crew attentive and professional, the pilots are the best in the industry and ife absolutely fine. the club world product is competitive with the better european airlines such as lufthansa and streets ahead of most us carriers. the problems start when anything goes wrong - which it frequently does given the mostly old fleet especially on non-core routes. in my case, the flight was cancelled due to the inbound aircraft (an ancient 747) going technical. then a comedy of errors. first the hotel vouchers just said ‘holiday inn’. there are about 15 in san diego- cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place, arriving at hotels with no booking etc etc. next, the replacement flights. the clunky app kept just saying error for some reason. eventually the full website on a pc showed my replacement flights. but no booking refs or any statement if these were being offered to me, were confirmed or whatever. on calling ba they wouldn’t talk to me because i ‘failed’ security- i didn’t know the billing address of the specific booking which was done by my company’s travel department despite having a full executive club account that was associated with the booking and which they could have used. the next day i went to take the replacement flights- alaska airlines to newark then sas to stockholm. despite getting a boarding card and making it to my seat on the plane, i was pulled off minutes before takeoff. ba had not paid for the flight! a reservation had been created but no ticket issued. ba then booked me on a roundabout route back via chicago plus a 12 hour layover from 4am to 4pm, getting me home over 36 hours after my original reservation. later i spotted that the next ba flight which would get me home much sooner now had tickets available online, why was i not on this? when i called they had no explanation and only agreed to ‘exceptionally’ change my flight again after i complained about all of the above. finally, i arrived home after a 24 hour delay and a roller coaster of incompetence. in summary, when all goes well, ba is better than it was and staff are doing a heroic inflight job. but old planes, rubbish back office it infrastructure and plain incompetence mean this airline can be hell if anything goes wrong. and bear in mind i was travelling in business class- who knows how they treat economy passengers.",28th January 2020,Sweden,Business Class,no,5,Gatwick to Venice,Solo Leisure,Yes,Negative

"toronto to geneva via london. i stopped flying ba about three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their service. apparently things have improved somewhat since, so i decided to give them another try. overall, i was happy with my experience, save for two major gripes. on the plus side: i flew on new aircraft, which were comfortable, albeit with the usual narrow seats for modern aircraft (same with all airlines). legroom on the 787-9 was generous and seemed to be more than the official 31"". pilots were very good and informative, as always with ba. quality of food on long-haul has definitely improved since the bad old days of soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches; i rather enjoyed the meals served, which were on nice large trays. the ife was just about adequate, though surprisingly dated for such new aircraft. cathay pacific's is far superior. the two major downsides: 1. the new basic economy fare. it is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengers. ba really need to get rid of it. virtually everyone on long-haul has to check in a bag, so please just include it in all airfare types. if i wanted to be nickle-and-dimed, i'd fly to gatwick on a charter airline. also, not being able to choose a seat even at the time of check-in is infuriating. i was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the entire rear half of the plane was empty! this just goes to show that you will get a middle seat unless you pay. thankfully, the lady at check-in changed it to a window seat free of charge after i asked nicely. 2. no complimentary catering on short-haul. seeing as virtually all passengers flying to/from heathrow are connecting to/from long-haul flights with ba and have spent at least $1,000 on their airfare, i resented a drink and snack not being included on the short-haul segment of my trip. ba should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on low-cost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip. if ba would get rid of these two new features, i would not hesitate to fly with them again, as everything else about my trip was pleasant. as it is, i would still consider other airlines.",22nd January 2020,Canada,Economy Class,yes,3,BLR to LHR,Business,Yes,Positive

"gatwick to tirana. i was incredibly disappointed by the service provided on this flight, because it was virtually impossible for me to differentiate what made this flight different from being in economy. business class passengers boarded at the same time as economy class passengers, there was no curtain dividing economy class from business class, and the people in economy class had taken the liberty of removing my cabin bag from my space above my seat, to three seats behind me. . the seats were the same seats you have in economy, the difference being that the middle seat is empty, thus creating a divide between window and aisle seats.  i encountered odd problems with the meal as well - the lovely cabin crew member notified me that i had no other choice but to eat pasta for dinner because other choices had finished. you are better off in economy as you pay less and get the same service. flight left on time and landed early. british airways have in my opinion the  best inflight w-fi service. for 10 pounds you get unlimited, very high speed wi-fi where you can stream youtube videos. they offer cheaper packages as well where you can get unlimited texts.",11th January 2020,United Kingdom,Business Class,yes,5,Denver to Heathrow,Family Leisure,Yes,Positive

"brussels to bangkok via london. club world from london to bangkok on 17 nov 2019, seats 15c and 15d. it was a boeing 777, with a 2-4-2 seat configuration in the business cabin, which gives the cabin a crowded impression. the seats are comfortable, with a flat bed (+mattress!), good selection of entertainment, although a rather small screen. the food menu offers different choices of starters, main course and desserts. the food was disappointing, i had smoked salmon as a starter, and british beef as main course. my soup was cold, mybeef was overcooked) and quantity was economy class-like. the service is very friendly, but not personal. i’m used to be adressed by my name when i fly business class.  while serving the meals, they forget serving me wine. the amount of cabin crew is not enough for a crowded business class cabin. after dinner i went to sleep. the seat is turned into a real bed, with an extra mattress and a good pillow. the space is narrow, it is difficult to make the bed. once the bed is made, there is no place to put  personal stuff. i had a real good night of sleep though. if your seat is not at the aisle, you have to step over someones legs to go to the toilet. the toilets are small and simple, not cleaned frequently enough. when i woke up, breakfast service was running.  the breakfast is good.  yoghurt, pastries, fresh fruit, and a full english breakfast. overall, british airways world club is a rather standard business class, lacks personalized attention and lacks the feel good experience.  if ba wants to compete, they have a long way to go. i hope they can make it up a bit on our return flight.",2nd December 2019,Belgium,Business Class,no,3,BLR to LHR,Business,Yes,Positive

"london to vancouver. i used to fly this aircraft and route for many years until it was no longer priced competitively. i flew on the 14th and it was a remarkably bad experience. food service was very poor in most aspects. i had the chicken tandoori which was far too spicy for most palettes. no drink was offered with the meal which was astonishing. rather, tea and coffee an obviously far cheaper offering was supplied soon after the dinner tray was handed. i had to ask twice for a beer before it was delivered.this then put me out of sync with the service. the one time (yes one time!) offer of tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completely. service itself was not good with no warmth or hospitality. on a 9hr flight engagement is pretty critical! our hostess/host seemed to be only interested in those sitting in the extra legroom seats and essentially ignored everyone else. the cold snack was a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landing. the entertainment system is a joke as it is so old. i had become so accustomed to a normal/newish tv screen that i was blown away that this system was still in place. the screen size was the equivalent of your phone’s. no music selection worth talking about so i just used my ipad. on this or similar routes i have flown air canada, westjet, virgin atlantic, air transat. ba was by far the worst and some of those airlines are budget in nature and offer paid meals only. i cannot believe that the mighty ba offers such a terrible product in 2019. i will spend more to fly better and actively avoid ba on long haul.",16th November 2019,Ireland,Economy Class,no,9,London to Luanda,Couple Leisure,Yes,Negative

"tirana to london gatwick. i fly british airways around six times a month thanks to my work, and while i almost always have a pleasant experience, this past flight definitely outdid all the others. we boarded and departed exactly on time, with a very friendly and welcoming crew. while the flight was fully booked, my travel companion and i were lucky that no one was sitting on our row so that we could have an empty middle seat, and therefore more space. the best surprise of this flight by far was the availability of wi-fi which i have never had on any other british airways flight within europe. in fact, the wi-fi package i got which included only texting, was unlimited and incredibly fast - as good as my home connection! this truly made this flight more enjoyable as it allowed me to continue my business even during the flight which is extremely valuable to me. something that british airways can improve on would be leg space, which in this flight i noticed was particularly tight, although that is a common problem for me as i am 1.88 cm tall. also, for unknown reasons, no food or snacks were served on this 2 hours 45 minute flight, only drinks. this was a slight struggle as i had skipped breakfast, but i managed well. the flight however arrived ahead of schedule and we de-boarded quickly. i always recommend ba - and will continue to do so.",12th November 2019,United Kingdom,Economy Class,yes,3,London to Sydney,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

"the start of our journey back from from efl was inauspicious, with hundreds of delayed and stranded passengers crammed into the departure lounge, awaiting flights on airlines other than ba. as it was, weather in the uk plus air traffic control issues meant that departure was delayed by 90 minutes. once airborne in a refitted a320 (complete with a nice fresh leather smell!), cabin crew in ce were friendly and efficient, and the food (including a cod dish) was quite reasonable. it was interesting to note that the refit hadn't extended to the toilet which was looking distinctly worse for the wear. a big plus on the flight - and a first for me - was wifi, which actually worked and was quite fast - although at a cost of £4.99 for an hour's use. i thought it was meant to be free for business class passengers, but evidently not. landing made up for some time but we were parked right in the middle of nowhere because of a backlog of flights. however, ba had laid on a separate bus for ce passengers and we were out of the airport 30 minutes later. so, not too bad, all in all.",26th September 2019,United Kingdom,Business Class,yes,3,Heathrow to Las Vegas,Family Leisure,Yes,Positive

"having booked this flight a week before the ba strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two days before i flew and not in fact the day before, i was apprehensive as to how it would operate. the check-in and security clearance at t5 took only 15 minutes. personally i do not like the self service bag and tag drop that ba operate as one is not 100% confident that i did everything correctly. boarding is by the new fare group system (1 to 5) which depends on how much one has paid for the ticket. again i'm not a fan of this. possibly due to the previous day's strike and the need to accommodate passengers from canceled flights, the aircraft was a large a321. boarding was however smooth. on board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the eurotraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room (i'm 1m.79cm and my knees do not touch the seat in front). the departure was only 15 minutes behind the scheduled departure time. in flight there were 3 cabin staff in the euro traveller cabin (believe 2 in club cabin) who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than 30 minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight. again it is a shame though that ba have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airline. the landing at tegel was 30 minutes ahead of schedule. all in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel booking. tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only 2 border police carrying out immigration controls for over 200 passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further 30 minute wait for luggage but this was not ba's fault.",21st September 2019,United Kingdom,Economy Class,yes,3,London to Luanda,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

"london to dublin. it was never my choice to fly with british airways and i will never fly with them again. i was supposed to fly with american airlines from the usa to dublin, but i had a connecting flight from my origin city to chicago. unfortunately, my first flight was delayed due to weather, which caused me to miss the flight from chicago to dublin. i was put on a flight to london instead, which i had to run for when i finally made it to chicago, and my bag did not make it on the flight. i then flew with british airways from london to dublin. i was told to file a lost baggage claim with ba, which i did. i was told that the bag would be transferred from american to ba when it arrived in dublin. using american’s baggage tracking system, i was able to confirm that the bag arrived the day after i did around noon on saturday. i am writing this review on the following sunday and the bag is still not in my possession. ba’s customer service is terrible. if someone there tells me one more time to just wait and be patient, i am going to lose it! my bag has been sitting at the airport in the same city i’m in for more than a day and i can’t get it. talk about serious frustration. i don’t know which airline is at fault for the delay, but the difference is that when i called american, the rep did everything she could to find out the status of my bag. and even though their baggage claim desk was closed when i called, she still tried to call an internal number to see if anyone was still around. unfortunately she couldn’t get hold of anyone, but she left them a message and told me exactly who i could call and when to call them the next morning. i did not receive that level of service from ba. i even asked if they could call the airport and was told, “we are not authorized to call airports.” why in the world wouldn’t they be authorized to call their own baggage department? i am not thrilled with either airline, but at least american has made some attempt to help me. this has ruined the first three days of a trip that i planned for two years. if you do check a bag and it’s lost or delayed, don’t expect any help if you flew with ba. and here’s a tip: if you are dealing with a lost or delayed bag in a country you don’t live in, don’t call the generic customer service number on the website you would normally use. dig around and see if you can find a number for the airport you flew into. you will get a lot more information and assistance that way.",16th September 2019,United States,Economy Class,no,9,BLR to LHR,Business,Yes,Negative

"hong kong to copenhagen via london. the whole experience is a nightmare to me and my wife. my wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st august because our two pieces of luggage were left in heathrow airport by ba staff when we took the transit flight from the uk to copenhagen. we went to menzies in cph and they filed a repor. we stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found, they should be sent to our air b&b house in marstal in cph on or before 3rd august or deliver to the hotel we stayed in cph if they were found on 4th august. on 2nd august, we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the ba website showed that one of our luggage was found while another one had a possible match. therefore, we kept phoning and emailing menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so. and the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport, which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset. the system even changed the latest delivery date to 3th august 2020 instead of 2019 and we could not correct it by ourselves! on 3rd august, menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport. unfortunately, when we went to the cph airport on the 4th august, they told us that they had already sent the 'found' luggage to the island in marstal on 4th. apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date. they then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office. we did find the other one by ourselves in the airport, which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match one! they were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the ba to push them to find the baggage for us. we believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up. we were so confused which bag was really missing. we finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in marstal to the airport and send it to the uk address which was our next destination. when we came back to the hotel in the evening on the 4th, we phoned menzies again and found out that our luggage in marstal had been sent back to the airport at 8 pm on the 4th. hence, we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the 5th august before we flew to the uk. however, when we came to the airport again, we couldn't find our luggage and the staff didn't explain why and just told us to leave. if the luggage was sent it to the airport on the 4th, how come it would disappear on the 5th? the staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us. this service was totally unacceptable. we spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing! you can't imagine how furious and frustrated we were! we are literally sick of phoning menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere. now that menzies staff asked us to pressure ba to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage. that's how ridiculous things have been for us. we are sure that you could do something about it. my wife has lost all her personal belongings since day 1 of our trip.",23rd August 2019,Hong Kong,Economy Class,no,3,London to Luanda,Couple Leisure,Yes,Negative

"johannesburg to cape town return. this flight was operated by comair, and thus it was quite different from a normal british airways flight in europe. check in at the priority line was uneventful, however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that oneworld sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if i was flying business. johannesburg airport and cape town's domestic terminal is laid out very similarly. their lounge, called slow is actually impressive. although there was no full english on offer unlike the british airways galleries lounges in other places, there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks, pastries and small bites. they even had a coffee counter with made-to-order drinks. i assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol. very impressive for a domestic business class lounge. priority boarding was honoured, and boarding was an orderly process. i would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6, as there is actually tons of legroom in front. i reserved an exit row and paid an extra £7 per exit row during the booking. these seats were old and plush, however i do prefer the newer leather seat used on their european aircraft as those offer better support. i had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats, in a 2x3 configuration. i did not expect this as business class in europe is normally just a blocked middle seat. there were several drink services on this two hour flight, and a hot breakfast with either a bacon, sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option. needless to say, a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated. it was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh. the crew were very friendly, making casual jokes and giving a down-to-earth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days. they were quite rushed, but understandable due to the short flight time. in cape town airport, it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplane/board. but since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737, it works and makes sense. i think that this flight has improved my opinion on british airways, and they were the same price as the competition, south african airways. i would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare, given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on africa's busiest air route. for the price paid, i'd be happy to fly them again.",29th July 2019,Thailand,Economy Class,yes,3,London to Tampa,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

(see picture) and on top of everything i find myself having to put my luggage (just a backpack) far behind my seat because they are choosing to bring the extra hand luggage that doesn’t fit anymore in coach to business class. ridiculous service so not worth the x2.5 cost that a business class ticket goes for. feel totally ripped off.",10th July 2019,Canada,Business Class,no,5,LHR to CPT,Couple Leisure,Yes,Neutral

"cpt is definitely getting its act together: ba's galleries lounge is spacious with a good selection of food and staff actually managed to make the group boarding work for once. the upper deck is still one of the better bets when flying in club world. that's despite the ancient yin/yang seats and the tiny ife screen with appalling resolution. the new bedding certainly helps cushion the hard seats and the large pillow actually feels luxurious. the dinner service was according to the new cw 'soft' design, which meant delays while plates were brought out to passengers individually. on the whole, i think it works and having the 'triple bread' roll already on the tray means that the bread is there when you want it, rather than served with the dessert. breakfast has been streamlined, too, and staff actually paid attention to the request cards filled in before takeoff. apart from some inevitable turbulence, the flight went according to plan and we touched down 30 minutes ahead of schedule. a good flight, overall, but an old style business class experience.",27th May 2019,United Kingdom,Business Class,yes,5,Gatwick to Venice,Solo Leisure,Yes,Positive

"i was seated right next to the galley and lavatory in the aisle. during the safety talk the cabin crew were only metres away talking loudly which was irritating, so my initial impression was disappointed for business class. however, into the flight i found one female crew very personable and was offered a seat two back. i was not provided with a complimentary travel wallet, so did not realise that socks and sleep mask were available, and i needed to ask for a pillow. the menu guide was on cheap paper and, with no convenient place to store it for reference later, was very ordinary. the evening meal was acceptable (soup, steak/veg, fruits ) was ok served with freezing cold cutlery. bed was ok but nowhere to store spectacles or personal needs such as spectacles, asthma puffer, or water bottle. the breakfast of juice and cereal/yoghurt was fine but the single poached egg was like a rubber ball and the included fish patties were unpalatable. the lavatory was spacious and allowed room to change clothes ready for the connecting flight. overall i expected a better level of attention to detail and a more upmarket delivery. the only business class addition feature that i appreciated was being able to stretch out for some sleep. ba ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a qf 11 from singapore to brisbane, insisting i needed to collect my luggage, leave arrivals and recheck in for next flight. i am 73 with some mobility problems, requiring assistance, so this was a worry for me. when i arrived in singapore, the kind assistance girl arranged to take me to a special transit desk where it was no problem arranging for my bags to be forwarded to next flight.",23rd May 2019,Australia,Business Class,no,5,London to Tampa,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

"gatwick to barbados return. i normally travel on ba with low expectations with the result that i am not too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly surprised. the outbound flight was about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an ok cabin crew that did just about enough to look after us and make the flight uneventful. however, the flight did leave bang on time and managed to land in barbados before the virgin flight that was scheduled to leave gatwick five minutes before us, with the result that we got through arrivals quickly. the return flight a week later managed to reinforce my low expectations of ba with one of the poorer flights that we have experienced over the last few years. once again when you travel west to east, the crew (specifically one lady who was looking after our part of the cabin) somehow feel they have to rush through every part of the drinks and meal service that it becomes an ordeal. the pre departure drinks were missed on all of seats on the left hand side of the pe cabin (not a big deal but irritating non the less). no bread was served with dinner, despite there being butter on the plate, so i presume it was missed. my wife had ordered a veggie meal and was served about ten minutes before everyone else, which was fine. however, as the crew were serving the remaining meals, there was a continual dialogue across the two aisles about what selections they each had on their respective trolleys. when they reached our row, they somehow thought it would be a good idea to try and pass a hot tray of chicken in gravy across the four middle seats with the result that the red hot gravy spilled on the my wife's remaining food and lap, although fortunately she did have a napkin in place which absorbed most of the liquid. it also spilled on my kindle which thankfully had the cover closed. a very brief apology was given but without any sincerity and i suspect blissfully unaware of the obvious mistake they had made. my wife's wine was replaced but not the rest of her dinner. once again we landed on time, which was a good thing. overall, the return flight was extremely poor.",22nd May 2019,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,3,LHR to CPT,Couple Leisure,Yes,Neutral

"gatwick to malaga. check in was fairly quick. the check in area at gatwick is quite nice although they are failing with general upkeep. the whole area needed vacuuming and there were stains and signs of chewing gum on the carpets. if you’re not going to look after it then you better just having normal airport flooring. the lounge at gatwick is really nice and whilst it was very busy, there were still available comfy and desk style chairs to suit. the food and drink offering was very good. tasty and varied. on board i was lucky to be able to book the exit row, which actually makes the seats better than club in my opinion. food and drinks service was fairly slow although being near the front this wasn’t a problem for me. the food offering is fairly poor really, a couple of sandwiches or snacks.. drinks selection is better. what was very nice was, near the end of the flight i was given a free glass of champagne for being a silver member. i wouldn’t expect this, and i’m sure it’s just because they had a bottle to use up, but it was a nice gesture to show to frequent flyers. still no wifi or wifi based in flight entertainment offered. priority bag tags as usual are kind of irrelevant. my bag took quite a long time to come through and was preceded by dozens of non priority bags. overall a decent flight, and very good value as i paid using avios. being silver and getting lounge access and free seat selection was a massive plus.",19th May 2019,United Kingdom,Economy Class,yes,7,Rome to Heathrow,Solo Leisure,Yes,Positive

"st lucia to gatwick on which my wife and i were both involuntarily downgraded from premium economy to economy due overbooking on the flight. it should be noted that at no time was there any announcement for volunteers for downgrading at vieux fort airport. i now know from your cabin crew that it is normal practice for appeals for volunteers to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrades. at the time of going through the baggage hall getting our boarding passes we queried them as none had seat numbers on them to which we were told to just to go through security and our seats would be allocated when we went through the departure gate. once in the departure lounge all four of us were tannoyed to return to the baggage hall when we were then told that my wife and i were being downgraded to economy. the male telling us this more or less indicated this was the only way we would be getting on the flight giving us £75 per each on a prepayment card as compensation under article 7.3 of ec 261/2004 stating however that this did not affect our statutory rights. he then told us he would find us in the departure lounge and then all four of us had to go through security once again. the male who we spoke to in the baggage hall did not come and find us, we had to go and find him when he also told me that he had put my wife and i on a row with no other passengers which we assumed, rightly or wrongly, was so we could not tell people sitting beside us about the poor service we had received from ba. however two other passengers did come and sit beside us with the passenger sitting beside my wife telling her this was because the seat they had been allocated was soaking wet and smelt of urine and the cabin crew had asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seats next to us which was no problem. what further concerned me even more was one of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasions just prior to approaching gatwick and after the pilot had requested seat belts on and seats in upright positions, never telling the passenger to raise their seat. ba’s latest advert celebrates 100 years of ba but for me their service is going backwards. the music that accompanies the advert is called ‘salvation’ and by the end of the flight my wife and i were surely seeking it. article 10 of ec regulation 261/2004 is worth reading if this happens to you.",11th April 2019,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,5,London to Tampa,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

"my husband and i flew on british airways flight ba-228 from baltimore to london heathrow leaving on the 12th february 2019. every aspect of the flight was poorer than what budget airlines have to offer. the plane was shabby and dated. the seat reclining facility did not operate properly, was not that comfortable, and we had less legroom than the equivalent with budget airlines. the touch screen tv monitor was not working properly. one ear bud on the headphones did not work. the audio socket was too loose for the headphones so the plug kept falling out making it difficult to enjoy the in-flight entertainment (which in itself had a dated choice). the pillow was disgusting and kept falling out of the flimsy cover. the air conditioning lacked consistency alternating between very hot and very cold air. the restroom occupied sign always lit up as vacant even if it was occupied. however what made the flight very unpleasant was the bad attitude of the cabin crew. they were abrupt, unfriendly and quite clearly did not want to be there. there was one exception, an extremely pleasant older crew member who greeted us on and off the flight. there did not appear to be any organisation or smooth co-ordination when distributing the meals. our two trays of food where placed on top of each other and practically thrown at us by a sour faced crew member. this flight was one hour late making us nervous about catching our connecting flight. there was no information or instructions given to us about connecting flight gate numbers before we landed. unlike all the other airlines that i have travelled with there were no staff member greeting the connecting customers to point them in the right direction or re-assure them. british airways would be my last choice of an airline to travel with and i would only fly with them again if there was no other option.",15th February 2019,Spain,Economy Class,no,3,BLR to LHR,Business,Yes,Negative

"i booked a british airways flight from amsterdam to london heathrow. in the beginning everything went normal and smooth. check-in and boarding was easy and on time and once everyone boarded the problems started one after another. first an announcement was made by the pilot about a flight delay due to strong winds in heathrow (fair enough). afterwards the wind problem was resolved but a passenger decided to leave so they had to take out his luggage. after that we received a 3rd announcement stating there is a computer malfunction at schiphol airport and they are doing their best to resolve it. this caused us already about 45-60 mins delay but me and other passenger still remained calm and relaxed and then the hell started. we received permission to take off after 7 mins and then the pilot offered passengers who do not wish to travel to leave the plane. of course there were many passengers who were travelling on business and i guess too delayed to make it on time for their meetings so they decided to leave. the crew warned them that this might cause terrible delay and problems for the other passengers but they still decided to leave. so a group of passengers left and we missed our opportunity to take off. then the pilot announced that we can take off after 2,5 or 3 hours. the flight was full of overseas travellers. we spent 2 hours sitting in a plane which was not moving anywhere, people unboarded the plane 4 times in total and no food or water was offered to us. we had to line up next to the bathroom to purchase food and drinks and pay for it. the overall experience was terrible and it ruined the whole plan for my first day in london.",12th February 2019,Netherlands,Economy Class,no,3,Gatwick to Venice,Solo Leisure,Yes,Negative

"tokyo to london. i was looking forward to this flight because of the club world ticket and because it was my first time flying on a boeing 787. we had a good check-in experience, breezed through the airport and enjoyed the jal lounge at narita. we boarded on time and first impressions of the boeing 787 were good: a modern plane with nice mood lighting as we boarded. the food and wines were really good. i had a beautifully-presented japanese starter followed by a bento-style lunch as a final reminder of the holiday and my wife chose the western options. there was plenty of choice on the ife and there was a big screen. on the downside, the cabin was too hot which made it difficult to sleep on the flight. this was a problem that we encountered on our outbound journey too. the seat was comfortable and reclined fully but i find the layout of ba club world a little awkward because you have to step over another passenger's footrest to access the aisle. the cabin crew were efficient but seemed a bit exhausted and could have been more friendly and welcoming. the context to this review is that we spoiled ourselves and flew in first class on the way to tokyo. we had an amazing experience with such comfortable seats and exemplary service from the cabin crew. we both felt a bit disappointed with the return flight in comparison and felt there was room for improvement, but at the same time our expectations might have been too high because of the previous flight.",11th February 2019,United Kingdom,Business Class,yes,5,Denver to Heathrow,Family Leisure,Yes,Positive

"newark to bangalore return via london on ba premium economy (world traveler plus). i paid about 40% more for premium economy (about $600 extra) so approximately $150 per leg. was it worth it? i'd say broadly yes, though i wouldn't want to pay very much more than that and it would be harder to justify if only one leg of 6-7 hours was involved. before boarding: premium economy does get a standard 2 checked bag allowance whereas economy is 1 bag though there are numerous exceptions where they allow 2 (and india to us/canada is one of those exceptions though it isn't clear if it applies for travel originating at either end). so i am not sure if i got an extra bag or not but i did use the 2 bag allowance boarding: you board in zone 3 after first/business & the oneworld elites. that is helpful as you do get dibs on the overhead storage - if it doesn't fit in premium economy you can always put it in front or behind before economy begins boarding. this means you also get off fairly quickly - which can help if you're in a hurry to get through security at heathrow for a connecting flight or through immigration at your final destination. in flight: there is a welcome drink for premium economy (champagne, juice, water depending on the departure time). there is also a hot towel service also. 787 cabin: the 787-9 has a nicely done premium economy cabin. 2-3-2 seating as opposed to 3-3-3 in economy. so a somewhat wider seat. seat pitch is also decent. these are new style slimmer seats though possibly less cushioned than what you get on older seats - but seat was comfortable. the food tray comes out of the armrest and there is some seat back storage (though not much). there is a small drinks tray built into the front of the arm rest which you share with your neighbor. there is a recliner style footrest with support for the calf. you do get a noise canceling headset which is nice and a basic amenities kit with eyeshades, socks and toothpaste. the seat back screen is large and easy to use. there is no restroom in the cabin but one immediately behind in economy - so not a long walk 777 cabin: 777 has a 2-4-2 seating in premium economy (same as club world) as opposed to 3-3-3 in economy. the 777 version used on the lhr-blr sector has a very small premium economy cabin - just 3 rows of seats. this gives it a sort of cosy feel. you do have to walk all the way through the economy section immediately behind you to get to the restroom. economy looked pretty full on both the legs on the 777 but premium economy was not full - and i had the seat next to me vacant on both legs. that helped me stretch out for sure. the seat back screen on the old 777 is much smaller and the seats are older but possibly more cushioned than the slimmer 787 seats. food: nothing much here. i didn't think it was all that different from what a regular economy meal would have been. it was ok - nothing to write home about. all in all, for such a long journey, the premium economy product did offer some additional comfort along with the early boarding and baggage. worth it on extra long haul like us to india. bit harder to justify on shorter flights or fewer legs.",7th January 2019,United States,Premium Economy,yes,5,Denver to Heathrow,Family Leisure,Yes,Positive

(i have flown both in 1st). the food is also business class quality. more casual dining rather than fine dining. taking one meal; it starts with an amuse bouche. one motley round mozzarella bit of cheese. one tomato. one bit of green stuff. one straggly piece of prosciutto ham. total cost about 30p. outstanding! i then had prosciutto wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan. totally, utterly boring. my wife had the soup which she said was nice. i then had jerk chicken dish. it was just about okay. the glassware and chinaware was okay. the cutlery was poor quality, the stuff you'd expect in pizza express, except the stuff in pizza express is better. i accept we are stuck with this 1st product for the next 30 years or so, but there is so much ba could do to improve the ""cheap"" look of their premium product. quality of presentation, food, champagne, even the menu covers. they trumpet the ""superb"" laurent perrier grand siecle champagne, which retails at £120 a bottle. its nice, but we all know this is inferior to what most airline 1st class offer in krug. £20 a bottle more! the alternative to 1st is of course the ghastly ying-yang club business class. the world's most hated business class in the sky. i'm a businessman and i know i could run this airline better, from a quality perspective. from a price perspective, if you bundle a 1st flight as part of a ba holiday, it sort of works out okay-ish. the fas as always were a very nice bunch of men and women.",22nd December 2018,United Kingdom,First Class,no,3,London to Tampa,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

"arrived at the airport to discover the flight had been delayed by several hours. during this time no clear information was available from the check-in desk (who were unable to confirm the delay) or elsewhere at the airport. over an hour after the flight should have taken off, and after most people had purchased refreshments, an announcement was made that each passenger would be entitled to a snack from an airport cafe - however no refunds were provided for the majority of us who had already done so. no complimentary food or drink was provided on board to make up for the delay. we landed at gatwick minutes before the last train left, meaning we then had to shell out £50 for a taxi home. despite this, ba refused to pay any compensation as the delay was less than three hours (2 hours 55 minutes to be exact!) and took over a month to respond to my request about it. this airline has been going downhill for several years but this experience cements ba's transformation into an overpriced easyjet. will not fly with them again.",9th December 2018,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,5,Heathrow to Las Vegas,Family Leisure,Yes,Neutral

"brindisi to london. flying from any airport that includes ryanair among its serving airlines has to be a bad sign. brindisi airport is at least modern but it makes few concessions to comfort and there was certainly no lounge for club europe passengers. there was also no priority check-in, or, indeed, priority anything. boarding was a fiasco, with two lines directed into pens, pending the mad dash to the plane, which then entailed using a rather weird, tiered set of steps that was just another queue. service in club europe commenced efficiently, but the cabin crew were of the breezy, cheery type who'd have been better suited to ryanair. the brief drinks service over, it was on to the the much-vaunted, new look club europe meal service. sadly, this proved to be just another cost-cutting, exercise, with everything piled on to the tiny plastic tray at once, and the appetiser and cheese 'courses' reduced to microscopic portions in little pots. and, of course, the seats haven't changed, although, interestingly, ba seem intent on packing ever more passengers into the club europe section, which means that the service is little different to the old economy. still, we arrived only 30 minutes behind schedule and the priority tags did result in our bags coming off the belt within only a few minutes. it's just that the whole inflight experience is so lacklustre and un-business-like.",17th September 2018,United Kingdom,Business Class,no,5,Rome to Heathrow,Solo Leisure,Yes,Negative

(ba should be embarrassed that it’s even offered) after leaving toronto 5 mins late, we arrived 5 early at the gate at heathrow which was welcome along with fast bags. for the return leg, i took the seasonal lgw to toronto flight which was a couple of hundred bucks cheaper. an upgrade to club world was a pleasant surprise. fast check in at lgw but slow slow slow security – even in the fast track lane. gatwick airport sell £5 premium experience and so the lane was full of folk paying 5 quid mixed in with ba fast track customers. excellent lounge once again with a good choice of food, and champagne available as a help yourself. efficient boarding and a great reception from the gatwick cabin crew. a fast offering of champagne (with a top up) before take off though the old safety video was still showing. the gatwick crew remind me of long haul crew from heathrow – more experienced, faster and a more relaxed service than mixed fleet crew at who follow service to the letter which results in a slow and impersonal service. fast bar service once airborne, followed by the old biz food service. overcooked steak (again) alongside jerk chicken and a veggie option. plenty of wine and drinks along with t&c. after a pleasant 3 hour nap, i woke to afternoon tea which was the standard old offering minus the clotted cream – off the menu due to supply issues. at the gate early and fast bags too. this club flight was weird in that its hybrid in nature and in transition to the new biz service. so new toiletries and bedding but the old menu. i hope gatwick catches up so ba don’t (unintentionally) promote two levels of biz service with lgw being the poor relative. on the o/w leg, premium economy was in desperate need of a revamp. the food is truly awful – both dinner and breakfast, and it really wouldn’t take much to add better food, bedding and an enhanced drink service as ba really lag behind air canada on this route with premium economy. i do not regard the experience as a premium economy service other than the seat. all that said, i felt that ba is regaining it’s mojo with great crew, improved on board experience (cuts reinstated) and on time performance. long may this improvement last!",15th August 2018,Canada,Premium Economy,yes,3,BLR to LHR,Business,Yes,Positive
"san francisco to london heathrow on the lower deck of the a380 - a very quiet smooth flight. did not want to pay the usual ba extortionate seat pre-reservation fees but still got seats together. after the real scrum at the departure gate - no apparent order, struggle to get through to priority lane, announcements completely inaudible etc we boarded to the reasonably comfortable, if narrow, seats. of course the usual ba club class ""scramble over the legs"" to get to the aisle and 8 abreast - not really a premium product in today's competitive business class world. welcomed with glass of champagne by attentive fa. ok meal - beef - with decent wines to accompany. much more up to date touch screen avod system but still a dreadful choice of ""blockbuster"" films. very extensive choice for breakfast - continental and cooked if you wanted it. really very good fa's - made you feel welcome. landed on time but baggage, for some reason, took about 3/4 hour to get to the belt. as usual i have mixed feelings about ba - if we are lucky enough to fly club/business class it is comfortable but you do feel a bit let down by the appalling layout and huge charge to pre-reserve seat. if virgin atlantic fly the same route i will always choose their upper class as everyone has aisle access and you don't have to pay to pre-reserve your seat.",15th August 2018,United Kingdom,Business Class,no,1,Heathrow to Las Vegas,Family Leisure,Yes,Positive

"this was a night flight new york jfk to london, so it was difficult to assess the service onboard, although what i experienced was certainly not bad. i think this was a very quiet flight, judging from the number of people around the gate, and there were only another 4-5 pax in first. but it's quite hard to tell when wrapped in the cocoons of the concorde room and first cabin. the former felt very exclusive but, as commented elsewhere, to the point of being fussy. it's irritating that they don't have any showers in the concorde room; i wasn't amused to check in at the galleries (business) lounge, be brusquely sent on to concorde, only to have to return to galeries upon learning that that were no showers in the former (it was 7pm, early august in nyc - of course i needed a shower!). departures from ny were running around 3 hours late that evening due to weather, and we were warned about a 60 min taxi to the runway. but we were very well looked after at that point; the cabin wasn't secured until just before takeoff, and the boredom of the taxi was eased by multiple - and very welcome - top-ups of champagne, seved by various members of the crew. likewise, all the perks of first class were there; i was addressed by name, the crew introduced themselves individually, dinner and drinks orders were taken, etc. all very courteous and professional. after such a long delay, i decided to have some more dinner as i was quite peckish; this came with some excellent wine, and was served promptly, so there was still plenty of time for sleep. but the soup was cold, and the main wouldn't have been out of place in business class. moreover, it would have been nice if someone had mentioned that the ba arrivals lounge at lhr would be closing by the time our delayed flight reached its destination; had i known this, i would have had breakfast and a freshen up on the plane. a very annoying oversight that led to quite a lot of inconvenience (picture a spoilt guy trying to insert contact lenses in t5 arrivals toilets...perhaps you saw me?). the cabin layout and bed: well, it's easy to find details of this elsewhere online. but it's certainly nothing special for first class. overall, a very acceptable flight, but i felt that the overly-fussy service sometimes got in the way of the practicalities of a short overnight atlantic crossing (where can i have a shower in the morning? where will i be having breakfast?). i've had business class flights from other carriers that have absolutely nailed these aspects.",12th August 2018,United Kingdom,First Class,no,5,Denver to Heathrow,Family Leisure,Yes,Positive
"amman to london. appalling service both on the flight and subsequent customer service. we are strict vegans so pre-booked vegan meals for our flight. meals were delivered as usual, and had the vegan slip on them, but as i was about to start eating i noticed that i had been given butter - this made me doubt the authenticity of the meal. when i called the staff over she had no idea what a vegan was, informing me that there was no meat in it. i had to explain to her what a vegan was (i.e; no dairy or eggs). it turns out that the so called 'vegan meal' had milk and egg in it. needless to say we did not eat our meals and they had no vegan meals. shortly after they came around with the drinks/trolley, so we asked for a coffee with soya milk - the staff to whom i had had to explain what a vegan was said ""oh i don't think we have that, but we have semi skimmed milk"". i had to re-explain to her that a vegan does not have milk she said she would go and ask. when she returned she said 'we don't provide that sort of thing."" that was strange, because 2 weeks ago on the outbound journey you did. so we had no meals, no hot drinks, and our video screen did not work. the customer service that followed from was more appalling, they could not care less, it took ages to get replies and when i did i was just palmed off. after several months of having to write emails i was informed that i had to submit everything by letter as they needed it on paper, which was just another way of getting rid of us. so we did this, after several more weeks they offered us the most pathetic compensation - basically the value of the meals that we could not eat - in vouchers.",11th August 2018,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,3,BKK to LHR,Business,Yes,Negative
"paphos to london gatwick in club europe. we had checked before leaving our hotel and realised that the flight was delayed, as were many other flights, due to bad weather the previous evening in uk. we checked in on time, only to be advised that there was no lounge available for club europe passengers and if we wanted to use the premium lounge we could pay! whilst we appreciate that there may not be a ba lounge it is normal that ba would have an arrangement with the local lounge provider as we have experience at many other airports when travelling in business class. we were offered a €10 voucher each, due to the delayed flight!! paphos airport was extremely crowded and having paid good money to travel in business class we were very disappointed with ba, that no lounge access was available. the flight itself was ok, although two hours late. the cabin crew provided good service and the meal service reasonable, my wife chose the chilli con carne and i chose the roasted chicken, both were a little dry. on arrival at gatwick at 01-00 we were through passport control quickly and then waited 45 minutes for the cases to be delivered, again very poor show. ba has some great assets, particularly the cabin crew, but we felt let down by the ground services at both end of this flight like us many travellers like to travel with a 'full service' airline and in this case ba were lacking.",9th August 2018,United Kingdom,Business Class,no,3,London to Tampa,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

"flew a now ageing b777 flight ba 0053 to seattle. pleasant flight with actually quite decent fillet steak for main meal. ok choice of wine / beer with meal and greeted with glass of prosecco when boarded. comfortable seat but it's the old bug bear - 8 across with ""over the legs"" access to the aisle. fortunately we were in the last row so my wife was in the window seat with direct aisle access. and we could look at each other and not at a total stranger. i know ba are saying that they are introducing direct aisle access for everyone in club class but this can't come soon enough - and 8 abreast is not exactly a premium product in the present circumstances, is it? absolutely terrible in flight entertainment system - although it was on demand the aircraft was fitted with a very ancient system: blurry, old screens, awful audio (take your own noise reducing headphones) and a pretty dreadful choice of movies.... fa's great welcoming and gave good service. but the main drawback with ba is their insistence that, having paid for a premium service, we then have to pay handsomely again to pre-reserve our seats (up to £105 per seat per journey!).  not what i expect from a flag carrier airline. we refuse to pay this extortionate sum - our choices have been noted on the loyalty card scheme and fortunately we have got seats together so far. so, although we had quite a pleasant flight to seattle with ba in club, if virgin atlantic fly the same route we will choose their upper class over clubworld - we can still reserve our seats for free with them.",30th July 2018,United Kingdom,Business Class,no,9,Gatwick to Venice,Solo Leisure,Yes,Positive

"london to amsterdam. ba's service has gone notably downhill in the past couple of years, but tonight's experience really takes the biscuit. i should now be in amsterdam - however, i am still writing this from london despite spending over 4 hours on a plane to nowhere. we boarded just about on time, around 1930, only to be told that due to weather there would be a delay of an hour or so. shortly after, we were told that the routes north of lhr were shut, and no planes were taking off. about an hour into the ordeal, we were told that the airspace had reopened, but there would be a 90 minute wait for a slot. one more hour in, we were told airspace was shut again. after 3 hours, good news! - or so we thought - we were to be on the move around 20 minutes or so later. we did then leave the gate, and we were given the safety briefing and taxied out to the runway. we were then stopped halfway down the taxiway and told that ams would be shut due to night flight restrictions by the time we would have arrived, so our flight wad cancelled. we taxied back to the gate, where we waited a further 10-15 minutes for ground staff to become available. i must say during this 4 and a quarter odd ordeal, the pilot was informative and tried to stay upbeat, and the cabin crew were very good. the crew gave us the in-flight service (minus alcohol) so we were well fed and watered. this is the full extent of my praise though. little was i to know that the real disaster was still to come. ba's ground handling was attrocious. we were told to head up to departures for hotel vouchers and rebookings. however, ba had cancelled around 7 flights, and the queues were very lengthy. vouchers were being handed out to sleep on the floor of a hotel ballroom because ""all the rooms were full"". i have never heard anything like it. this is beyond unbelievable. no assistance for children, elderly, and no preferential treatment for connecting passengers or premium passengers, as is the norm in this situation. further, the promised ""rebooking"" staff had all gone home - i was told to consult the ba app the following morning. ba's app has rebooked my flights - two days later, when my trip was for three days total. the feature on the app to select a different date for my flights, so i can replan my trip for another weekend, is broken. i guess i'll be trying out their call centre in the morning. this is all simply appalling. we all understand that adverse weather happens. but to keep us on a plane for 4+ hours when they knew before boarding that there would be delays is not on. moreover, ba surely know the opening hours of their destination airports. why they could not have prioritised the ams flight over flights to 24-hour airports i do not know. and as for the ground handling, i have never had an experience this bad. ba staff themselves were thin on the ground - they left most of the work to heathrow staff, who admittedly tried their best but hid behind the ""we don't work for ba excuse"". i've had a cancelled flight before and yet still wrote the airline involved a glowing review, because they genuinely couldn't have handled it better. by contrast, i don't see how ba could have handled this worse. they really are indistinguishable from the budget airlines these days, save for the good lounges if you fly business.",28th July 2018,United Kingdom,Business Class,no,5,BKK to LHR,Business,Yes,Negative

munich to london heathrow with british airways. i booked my flight online about 3 months ahead of my planned travel date and thought i would give this airline another try after a bad experience earlier in the year. i give full marks to ba on this occasion in most areas of service. i arrived at the airport rather stressed as my mobile phone had been stolen in a salzburg coffee shop. the check-in agent was very professional and reassuring towards me and entered into banter very willingly. he was professional and pleasant and very efficient too. the flight was on an a320 and boarding was managed well and the staff well presented too. the cabin crew were welcoming and orderly. although there was a delay it was managed well and the cabin crew explained matters as the flight progressed. i bought an overpriced tea and felt very comfortable. arrival was at a remote stand and then a bus. overall a very good experience with ba.,15th July 2018,United Kingdom,Economy Class,yes,3,Gatwick to Venice,Solo Leisure,Yes,Positive

"our original flight was cancelled as my wife and i were just disembarking from a cruise ship. we were then advised shortly after by sms that we had been automatically re-booked on a flight the next day, to london heathrow. this was not a lot of good when our car was parked at gatwick. i managed to get through to ba and was given a new booking to gatwick also the following day. we were offered no other assistance by the airline. the following day we turned up at the airport to find the new flight was running 40 minutes late. having eventually boarded the aircraft, we stayed at the gate for about 45 minutes before the captain deigned to tell us that the delay was being caused by problems at barcelona airport. shortly thereafter the captain advised us that we might wait for another two hours, so we would be given water. this was quickly superseded by a further announcement that a slot had become available at short notice, so no water was served. the real horror of this flight, however, was british airways new food service, whereby passengers buy food and pay by card/avios. this simply does not work. after one hour in the air, the trolley had moved about nine rows from the front of the cabin. eventually a flight attendant attempted to work from the back forward by running backwards and forwards from the trolley. about 20 minutes from touchdown he reached us and we asked for two cans of drink and a packet of crisps (potato chips). he returned to tell us he had no crisps and only one can, which we duly shared between us. having been on the aircraft for three and a half hours, this was the only refreshment we could obtain. i consider this to be completely unacceptable. if this is the level of service we can now expect from british airways, there is no point traveling with them. the budget airlines can do better at lower cost.",6th June 2018,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,7,LHR to CPT,Couple Leisure,Yes,Negative

"washington to bucharest return via london. i was originally booked in world traveller plus but at dulles check-in was offered a club world upgrade at just $499 more which i accepted - resulting flight was very comfortable with good food and top-drawer service. the two london-bucharest sectors both went well. but all this was just a prelude to my return trip. while in bucharest i sustained a fall and although i wasn't seriously hurt it was still difficult to walk long distances especially with heavy luggage. at the bucharest airport bag drop the agent noticed my situation and offered assistance, which i accepted - and was promptly wheeled through security, passport control and the (very long) corridors to the gate, then put aboard the plane. on arrival in london i was met by more assistance to whisk me through the vastness of t5 and onto the plane, this time with the pleasant surprise of another club world upgrade (this time for free). once on the plane back to washington the cabin crew couldn't do enough for me, checking how i was doing, going through meal choices (the menu this time round was a bit heavy on cheese and other dairy items i really can't eat but ultimately i still ate well), getting me drinks, and more. they were as professional and proactive a crew as i've ever experienced in 40 years of long-haul travel. finally, once arrived at dulles more assistance was waiting, right up to getting my cab. what could have been an ordeal on this return trip was turned into as relaxing and satisfying a travel experience as can be imagined - through the years i've had mostly excellent experiences with ba cabin crews and that's a big reason why i've stayed with ba all these years and will continue to do so. but a big standing ovation for the cabin and ground crews for these flights for above-and-beyond service - you're the best.",5th June 2018,United States,Business Class,yes,5,Heathrow to Las Vegas,Family Leisure,Yes,Positive

"london to cape town. flying first class with british airways is a hit-or-miss affair. but having secured a couple of return flights to cape town with avios, our expectations were running high as we entrusted our car to the meet and greet parking. unfortunately, terminal 3 isn't the best starting point and galleries first lacks glamour - or decent champagnes. the food on offer is adequate, although hardly first class. hoping for better on board, we didn't use the sit down menu. boarding was on time and according to ba's new group allocation. our seats - 2k and 3k - were a first for us, as we've previously gone for pairs in the centre. but seats a and k are definitely superior, with more storage space and better privacy. however, there's no escaping the fact that the relatively recent first class refit is in a relatively ancient plane, particularly when one inspects the shabby state of fittings in the toilets and galley. the ife is also showing its age and badly in need of an upgrade. but at least it didn't require rebooting on our flight. cabin crew in first were the usual mixed bag. the fa looking after our side seemed to be in the wrong job. food was better than usual, although a malfunctioning oven meant that we had to wait 30 minutes for our hot breakfast. landing was ahead of schedule and we were through immigration and baggage reclaim within 15 minutes. overall, a decent flight but let down by the attitude of the cabin crew and the age of the plane.",2nd June 2018,United Kingdom,First Class,yes,5,London to Luanda,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

"london heathrow to mahon. booked 9 months ago flights for first family holiday for 2 years for 2 adults, 2 children and 1 infant in lap (almost £1k for all of us. pre-booked seats at the same time. i was rather surprised when i got an email two weeks out saying “about your flight to madrid on the 26th may” when i was flying direct heathrow to menorca. airline assured me everything was fine. further concern when self-service check-in opened 24 hours out, wife and daughters checked in fine, me and my son were referred to airport check-in (despite all being on the same booking). an urgent call to ba i was told 1) i was probably being moved to a bassinet position. when i pointed out this was utter nonsense she reneged and said 2) infants can’t check in online which i now understand is also incorrect. my concern was well placed. at ba t5 bag drop, check in agent looked flustered, a note in the booking prompted her to call various people and after about ten minutes she handed me a bunch of boarding passes. only after i checked them she sheepishly admitted that our pre-booked seats were gone, my son and i had no seats at all and were standby, and my wife and daughters were dotted all around the cabin (16 rows apart). ‘prebooked seating is not guaranteed you know!’ after kicking up a huge fuss (i believe they can’t legally sit children below a certain age away from parents?) the check-in manager offered me no explanation other than full flights, but promised me it would be sorted once they got round to closing my flight. fast forward to the gate – utter carnage including the check-in supervisor (who cant have been more than 22) in tears. when i eventually got seen i was finally given a seat number for me and my son, again many rows apart from the rest of my family. as this was my sons first ever flight, i was absolutely livid that we couldn’t sit anywhere near each other. added to that, my son is breastfed so how we are going to manage feeding, kids needing toilet etc. i put my foot down and was eventually given a single middle seat two rows again from my daughters who were by now sat together thank goodness. we boarded the flight pretty much last after all the furore & holding my son i get to my assigned seat and someone is in it. asking to see his boarding pass surprise surprise he is in the correct seat. cue ba staff running around and frantically checking boarding passes. such is the confidence that the cabin crew have in their own ground staff, i even heard one of them mutter ‘check boarding cards and flight numbers as someone around here is on the wrong flight’! fast forward another 5 mins and the plane is now pushing back with me standing in an aisle holding my son with not an empty seat on the plane with me saying to my wife that we’re going to have to get off here and my children in tears. much checking of ipads and a ba staff member is then found (there were quite a few on the flight apparently) and hurriedly moved to the jumpseat whilst an announcement from the flight deck is booming out for everyone to take their seats or delay the flight (what seat?). raised a formal complaint and was told that they 'understand my frustration' which is nice. separate complaint raised to caa about a pushing back with passengers including an infant with no seat. conclusion is families avoid at all costs.",30th May 2018,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,7,BLR to LHR,Business,Yes,Neutral

"singapore to london. this was the second part of my sydney to london trip and looked forward to it as it was on a ba a380. now this aircraft, in qantas colours, is one i am very familiar with having flown around 30 sectors over the last 12 months with qf. as mentioned in my review of ba16 (which was the first leg of this trip) it is the on board soft product that is the problem. the same comments for that review apply here. the ife is a work of mystery in terms of content. on qantas, american, cathay one gets a really good mix of old and new movies, great music choices. those who compile the content need to look at what they mean by award winning (godfather, gladiator, brave-heart, roman holiday etc) are all things we as passengers want to see. some smart edgy team in soho, london pulled the content together forgetting that not everyone is edgy and want to see cutting edge stuff. ife is one thing on long haul. the other is food and beverage. the food quality was just substandard and something i read about constantly. on qantas (say qf1 from singapore to london) one gets the evening meal service, followed by weiss ice cream, a lindt chocolate along the way, midnight snack of a pizza or sandwich and morning breakfast (fruit or eggs with usual muffin etc. at the rear of the main deck is a snack bar and in the galley will be found, chocolates, banana bread, cheese and biscuits. you would need to be really hungry to get through that lot but the point is that it is available and offered. ba need to get away from a meal service on take off and landing and nothing in between. the a380 is a flagship aircraft and on qantas it is treated as such. i am a qantas fanboy and spend a lot of time on their planes. put the smartest, best looking crew onto a flagship as that is what people will remember. the ba crew were of a certain vintage more suited to lawn bowls. one guy looked like steptoe (for those who remember) and was a miserable. flying on an a380 should be an experience and i enjoy all my trips on that aircraft. ba have managed to reduce it to a very large low cost aircraft moving people from one point to another. that is sad given the stature of ba. i came back on ba31 from london to hong kong and the same comments apply. hard product is fine (except for no snack bar) but the soft product is lacking severely.",26th May 2018,Australia,Economy Class,no,5,BKK to LHR,Business,Yes,Positive
"sydney to london via singapore. it has been a very long time since i was on a long haul with ba of more than 9 hours. last year had a relative sprint from london to jfk and before that in 2002. the years have not been kind to ba. probably a mixture of the decline of ba and the emergence of other airlines. nearly all my long haul is with qantas on its a380, occasionally emirates on its version and then once in a while with cathay pacific and american airlines. the problem is not the hard product. a b777 or the a380 in whatever colour and decor is ordered is the same air frame. the b777 from sydney to singapore was fine. nosier than the a380 but that is well known. very comfortable seats and at 8 hours a relative sprint for those who call sydney home. it is the soft product that is lacking. check in was fine and despite being in economy had an express pass through security (being a gold ff with qantas). boarding was orderly and an on time departure and arrival into singapore. now its just a lack of polish with the soft product. no menu given showing what was to be served (as with cathay, emirates and qantas). the cutlery was really cheap and i mean cheap. kfc offers a better grade of plastic. i know in these days of security that proper silverware is not possible but someone at ba needs to check out the plastic used on cathay and qantas). the food itself was very bland; a salad that had seen better days and penne with some sauce that was over salty. qantas have done away with salads and simply give you a main dish plus garlic bread and a dessert. it's just the quality that is lacking. drinks? i have a tradition, something silly, about starting a journey off with a jack daniels and coke. this is available on qantas but no sir, we don't serve that. a note about the fa's: they were great but one gets the feeling that they are chirpy to mask some of the shortcomings with the product they are asked to deliver. final word about this leg is the ife. a touchscreen but it was slow in response time and the selection was diabolically bad. award winning or classic films with not a noted film from the last 30 years. one or two interesting things and some new releases. come on ba, for may being on a plane for that length of time is a perfect opportunity to catch up on much loved classics. as for music: well i'm 53 but still like the pearl jams etc of the world. we are not all into brit pop and edgy music presenters. if ba is serious about the airline business then it needs to sharpen up the soft skills, the food and beverage and add a touch of pizzazz about the airline. it is a mix of ba going back and many others coming up and beyond the standards that ba set many years ago.",25th May 2018,Australia,Economy Class,no,3,London to Tampa,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

"london to muscat first class. first time trying out first class on ba. check-in was fairly quick and efficient, didn't have much luggage, but the first wing did not feel very exclusive. i had selected window seat in advance and this was confirmed and still intact as i got printed boarding pass. concorde room was nice, well designed but quite crowded in some places. had to ask for a champagne two times out in the terrace, before it got served a good 20 minutes later. checkout out the cabana for an hour, which was not very appealing at all, and managed to miss the first 5 min of the 15min treatment i booked for the spa. onboard was informed there was a problem with the seat i had selected, and was issued a new aisle seat, which was disappointing. upon entering the first class cabin, i had a quick look at the seat, and it was not immediately apparent, there was something wrong. i asked a crew to check and they came back to confirm that i will indeed not be able to sit there, but there was no explanation of what was wrong given. i did not want to waste any time to settle in, the crew looking after me introduced himself and served me champagne and warm nuts as well as offering some magazines to read. seat was comfortable and spacious enough and seemed fairly private, with a small wardrobe to hang jacket. the tv screen seemed quite large and high quality. unfortunately the seat controls were not super responsive, and neither was the remote for the tv. soon after take off, i was informed i could eat when i like. arabic starter was great. had pre-selected main meal online. meal was of good quality and cooked well. had a dessert and the mixed cheese plate (not as good as other cheese i've had in some business class). surprisingly the entertainment system had a rather limited selection, i imagine on two ultra-long flights in the same month, one might run out of anything of interest to watch. after finishing the one film i decided to watch, i decided to try get some sleep. crew made the bedding while i tried to put on the pyjamas in the tiny first class bathroom. bedding was of good quality and comfortable enough. i missed breakfast, as i was still rather full from the dinner and pre-dinner at the lounge. overall, i was reasonably happy with the flight and the product. the crew were very friendly and professional. given this was first class, have to admit there was no wow factor, either with the soft product or ground experience. i managed to book flights for a good price during a promo, otherwise it would personally not be worth the price tag for a fairly short flight.",1st April 2018,United Kingdom,First Class,yes,5,Heathrow to Las Vegas,Family Leisure,Yes,Positive

"san jose, ca to london heathrow round-trip in club world. had originally booked in premium economy but received upgrade offers from british airways that were too go to pass up. extremely happy and impressed with level of service provided. glass of champagne upon boarding, premium whiskies and a nice fillet of steak for dinner. cabin crew came by constantly to see how i was doing on both legs. lie flat seat gave me 5+ hours of sleep on both flights. the seat itself was not as wide as i anticipated and the lie flat bed can feel somewhat claustrophobic but legroom is no issue. the 787-9 is a fantastic aircraft. comfortable and quiet. fast track passes an added plus. flying out of san jose is a bonus since i'm a ten minute drive to home. overall very pleased with british airways and the service provided. access to lounges at both airports another plus ! no complaints from me. will look to fly ba again later this year. just hope they have more offers for business class.",16th January 2018,United States,Business Class,yes,3,London to Sydney,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive
dubai to london. cabin looked dire and wasn't particularly clean. seats are dreadful. sat by the window and literally had to climb over another person to get to the aisle. product must be about 15 years out of date. food was of poor quality. no mid-flight snacks such as fruit salad or sandwiches.  second meal was tiny. arrived at a bus gate in london. no bus appeared for about 30 minutes. crew blamed the bus providing company. overall an awful experience i do not intend to repeat.,14th January 2018,Germany,Business Class,no,3,LHR to CPT,Couple Leisure,Yes,Negative

"toronto to london return – business to london and first back to toronto all on avios. fast check in at pearson with the usual friendly check in team. fast track was quick and in the new 3rd party lounge within 15 mins. ba (presumably to save money) have shut their lounge and gone to a 3rd party provider – premium plaza. its frankly awful, no class or professionalism, with limited wine and spirits options, and cheap and nasty food piled high. elevator music drove us mad, and we were pleased to leave the lounge prematurely to board the aircraft - (what on earth are you thinking ba?) fast boarding, though with fewer crew, the boarding service in club is fragmented. late with champagne, wash bag after take off etc. with only four crew working club, there just isn’t time to offer a quality pre flight experience. the new tray service for drinks is more professional but took ages. we were served drinks 80 minutes into the flight and as we were near the back of the cabin, had our meal 10 mins after being served drinks. all choices were available but the food is just not club standard. poor entrees, cheap salads and reminiscent of economy food of 15 years ago. ba really need to roll out the new meal service quickly – how long does the new pilot service to new york have to last for?? got some sleep, had an okay fast breakfast (passed on the vile looking egg and bacon muffin) with an early arrival and bags topping off a better than expected flight. returning on first was one of my better experiences via the new first check in, fast track and concorde lounge. excellent service on boarding, a fast drinks service after take off and some really well cooked food –all choices available. some decent sleep was followed by a really average afternoon tea. dry sandwiches with mean fillings, but okay cakes and scones. early arrival at the gate was spoilt by very slow bags (45 mins after landing). these were my first mixed fleet biz and first class service experiences. the crew were young, and lacking experience / knowledge but make an enthusiastic, polite and smart. however, they were clearly following the book to the letter which leads to slower and wooden service. long haul crew were cranky at times, but they would connect better and offer a more sleek / fast service which is what is needed on east coast flights. flowers have returned to the first class bathrooms, and the slide in quality and cuts in service seemed to have stopped, but ba really need to roll out the promised changes faster to retain premium customers.",8th January 2018,Canada,First Class,no,3,BKK to LHR,Business,Yes,Positive
"las vegas to manchester via london. fairly dire as always. ba is cutting the new club world product as i speak, before even having rolled it out. addicted to cuts. perfect partner for aa. so i get on board and am told i now need to purchase food and beverages on the domestic leg, so why did i not fly a low cost airline? there no difference whatsoever? the crew seemed fresh out of school and so inexperienced. and what do you get for food on a transatlantic 10 hour flight to vegas? a starter of lettuce and carrot and two unripe cherry tomatoes. no oil, just some grey vinegar, it was foul i assume, nobody ate it. the main was tomato pasta or curry. the curry was so appalling i ate none of it. the chicken was like paste, the sauce dried out, and the rice overcooked. i cannot bear fruit so the only normal looking thing, a mini blueberry muffin, was given to my ravenous neighbour. no cheese, crackers these days, nothing. served with cold tea. i really loved, also, being rammed on a transfer bus from t3 to lhr t5 having waited 30 minutes to get on bus sweating like crazy. the driver just kept shouting to move down the bus, it won't leave until it is full! then the busses onto the back of the plane even though the bridge is on. and to top it all of, ba now offers a free copy of the sun instead of the mail or express. i have another flight in may which is non-refundable, i am desperately hoping they move my flight so i can cancel, they usually do this 2 or 3 times a booking so feeling good. this is not a full service airline. it is fully no frills. the only exception is, i think, is the long haul canteen meal you get. the airline is a national embarrassment. the flight attendants try and have to cope with what they have been given, but the ground staff are beyond it. fly this budget airline at your own peril, think about spending a bit more. i'm going to try lufthansa, or thomas cook, though i admit i'm dreading that prospect.",8th January 2018,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,5,London to Tampa,Couple Leisure,Yes,Negative

"amsterdam to london. service ryanair wouldn't tolerate but with premium prices. every two years or so i fly with ba, and every two years i am reminded just why i don't normally fly with them. whilst not as bad as my previous experience (which chopped about 12 hours off a 2 day break to milan and left me £££ out of pocket as all public transport had stopped by the time we arrived, an no, they wouldn't refund me) we were still delayed. all the other airlines had their delays on the board so their customers could do other things. ba? didn't show the delay until we should have been boarding. get to the gate with my shopping (what else are you to do during a delay?) and am told that it must fit in my suitcase or they'll put one of my bags in the hold. even ryanair allows a bag of duty free on. it would obviously have fit under the seat next to my purse but no~ that wasn't allowed. once we were on board the reason became clear, just like easyjet, ryanair and many of the other budget airlines, ba doesn't include a checked bag, meaning that all the hand luggage won't fit in the cabin ergo their staff find silly reasons to confiscate your bag. so not only was the flight delayed, but i now had to wait for a suitcase. once we arrived at gatwick everything went smoothly, i managed to catch the last train to my destination (unlike the previous time i'd flown with them). additionally the staff were very rude and condescending towards passengers. do not fly ba, save your money and go with a budget airline. the colours may be gaudier but the service is the same and the staff are infinitely friendlier.",5th January 2018,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,3,LHR to CPT,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

london to toulouse. british airways is no longer a full service airline. to compete with easyjet and ryan air it has removed food and drink from economy class and replaced with m&s food. this is over-priced and not that great. secondly the food was never complementary- it was included in your ticket price. this was the case in this flight to toulouse. next time go to pret and get a meal from there and carry it on board. i asked for a glass of water. this came in the last 30 minutes of the flight once the trolley had gone down the aisle. at least offer people water - it is a human right. the seats too are tight and a rear toilet in economy has been removed to maximise profits. in this flight there was no spare tissue or toilet roll.  i was told by the cabin crew when i asked about the new service level that more may be in store for ba's comers - charging for food in economy class for long haul flights. i hope that this is not true. the only saving grace is a comprehensive network and flight times are good. customer care and service has gone. avoid ba if you can. consume your ba miles and shift to other full service carriers. they are better and more responsive.,10th December 2017,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,3,London to Sydney,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

"tel aviv to london. we arrived at the airport with a lot of time due to the stories of how long security can take. the stories were true, although it is actually a very efficient and well organised airport, they just have very thorough border and immigration services as well as all passengers face enhanced security scanning of hand luggage etc. there were limited priority options available for first class passengers, although i suspect that is more down to the airport than british airways. the lounge provided is a third party one and is the same for business and first, and isn’t really acceptable. if it was just business then it would be ‘fine i guess’ but there is not very much seating, the food offerings were almost non existent and drinks were limited. even the main coffee machine was broken so there was another, very complicated, machine with all instructions only in hebrew. at the gate there was the usual ‘priority boarding’ queue as well as the regular queue. but the priority queue included all first and club passengers as well as all oneworld emerald, sapphire and ruby members - which is a lot of people! whilst it is nice to offer a perk to all of those members, there really should be another queue for first and oneworld emerald as the queue was quite long. the service on board didn’t start off very well for me as due to some confusion amongst the crew i got missed out when crew were offering drinks amenity kits etc, and after seeing every one was finished and the crew were all relaxing at the front i had to go to the galley and ask. they were very apologetic and provided excellent service for the rest of the flight but those kind of mistakes really shouldn’t happen in first. the seat is comfortable and offers a reasonable level of privacy and storage space. annoyingly the ife has to be stowed for take off and landing, which limits how much you can watch. it was the thales entertainment system so the quality was reasonable and with a fairly good selection of things to watch. the food and drinks on board were all excellent, including a delicious veal cheek main course and some wonderful wines that went together very well. aside from the hiccup at the beginning, the whole experience on board felt very attentive and special. it would have been nice to have been referred to by name, which i have had before on ba and with other airlines, even in business class. on arrival the priority bags came out incredibly quickly and were on the belt before we got there, which was impressive as immigration had also been very quick. overall this was a very nice flight with a solid product and excellent crew, let down only by the ground service in israel. i used avios and a companion voucher for this flight so it worked out excellent value for money.",20th November 2017,United Kingdom,First Class,yes,3,London to Sydney,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive
"london to tel aviv. arrived at heathrow at about 5pm expecting it to be very busy, but check and security felt like it was 10pm, very easy and quick process (which included regular rather than fast track security as we didn’t follow the signs properly). we used galleries south lounge and first impressions were actually pretty poor, although they did later improve. the food offering on arrival was a few sandwiches, soup and some dry cake. this wasn’t really acceptable at all although about an hour after we arrived the evening meals were laid out and there was a good selection of hot and cold dishes which were quite tasty. drinks overall were good as always with british airways although champagne is only served on request and the quality of the one provided was really quite appalling. in terms of seating, there was enough for all the passengers in there, and it was quite busy, and due to it being broken up into different areas it felt like a nice place, although better variety in seating, including some more comfortable chairs, would be appreciated as well as a bit of modernising. this biggest failing was the staff in the lounge, which were more similar to staff in a factory canteen than what you find in competitors lounges. smiles are free and go a long way, and whilst being unobtrusive can be a good quality, eerily walking around slightly like a zombie, seruptitiously clearing your table without any interaction whatsoever was just plain odd! the other area which i find completely below standard are the toilets. whilst they are kept clean and there are some nice touches with flowers etc, the general standard of the toilet decor was more like a cheap gym locker room. the regular heathrow airport toilets are far far nicer and to a higher quality. whilst the individual toilet cubicles with self contained wash areas are nice, there aren’t really enough and some regular wash room facilities and urinals as well would make it easier. on board me and my friend had the centre two seats at the very back of the cabin. this meant that we basically had our own private suite as well as direct aisle access. these seats are fantastic when travelling with someone and as good as any business offering from any airline in terms of comfort, privacy and access. unfortunately this was an ancient 777 with the old ife, which is a completely unacceptable product in terms of resolution, selection and even the fact that some screens won’t even stay in place and fold themselves away! british airways need to have an active plan to refurbish or replace all of these aircraft, end of story! even the thales system is showing its age now, but this rockwell collins one makes vhs tapes look state of the art! the cabin crew were slightly mixed in terms of level of service and experience. some were clearly not in sync with each other when serving drinks and meals etc, and some were rather abrupt and unfriendly. others however were absolutely wonderful and made the whole flight a wonderful experience. food and drinks on board were actually quite good, although the on board service was not the new club world one on this route yet. overall it was a very enjoyable flight, and as i booked using avios and a companion voucher it was exceptional value for money. having said that, i would have still considered it good value even if paying cash.",20th November 2017,United Kingdom,Business Class,yes,5,LHR to CPT,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

"seoul incheon to london heathrow. this was my first flight on ba for many years. as a brit, i was actually looking forward to flying them in order to return home for christmas on board the relatively new b787. i was disappointed. the fare i paid on this occasion was relatively good value for a j class cabin - in my view. however, it was extremely disappointing to see that you have to pay to select your seat in j class. i do not know of and have not ever flown another airline which charges you for this and i certainly do not appreciate it. i was seated in row 1 by the window. my first experience in this cabin was a shock when i realised i was looking straight into the face of the passenger sitting next to me. and further that i had to step over the legs of the passenger in row 2 to get into and out from my seat. the tray table did not sit straight when pulled out for service. even in row 1, by the time the cabin crew came to take my meal order they were already telling me that two of the available options had already run out. this left me taking a korean option on a flight on ba where the majority of the passengers seemed to be non-korean. clearly something wrong with the meal ratios. they offer a serve yourself snack bar in flight. i went to the galley at one point and there was very little available to take food wise - it was mostly just drinks. it also seemed to be a fixed meal time - something else i do not appreciate in business class these days when dine on demand is a far better option for passengers. the ife selection was nothing more than average. i found the overall selection somewhat limited compared to other carriers. the service and product simply left me feeling that ba is way behind other carriers and i concluded that i would not make a point of flying with them again on a long haul route in a premium cabin.",16th November 2017,South Korea,Business Class,no,7,London to Sydney,Couple Leisure,Yes,Neutral

"british airways short haul business class is nothing more than an economy class seat and maximum 31 inch pitch, with lounge access and a meal thrown in. so is it worth paying three times the cost of an economy ticket? ba recently introduced business class on domestic routes and as i got a decent price for booking well in advance, decided to try it out. checking in was efficient, and the galleries club lounge adequate (no comparison whatsoever with asian or middle eastern airline lounges). priority boarding although announced, did not make any difference as economy and business class passengers were in the same queue and confused. having maneuvered into the cramped seat, i was offered a hot towel as soon as i sat down. i couldn't decide whether to be amused or embarrassed by the new celebrity cast safety video. it was more spot the stars, than listen to the safety instructions. but i guess it was something different ba was trying out. the service on board was surprisingly efficient and swift. soon after take off, a tasty snack and bar service with premium brands was offered on this one hour flight. the service was good, considering a one hour flight. despite a boeing 767, 2x2x2 layout, the cabin felt claustrophobic. to me, this was no different than economy seating, with virtually no leg room. how can this be branded as business class? is the extra cost justified to fly club europe? absolutely not.",13th November 2017,United Kingdom,Business Class,no,3,Rome to Heathrow,Solo Leisure,Yes,Positive

"london to santiago. cabin crew generally helpful and friendly. cabin a bit grubby; crumbs, nuts and grime in evidence. on the flight home as i took my seat i saw a bit of the wrapper of the ear plugs they give out which seemed to have been left over from the previous flight - evidence that whoever wields the vacuum cleaner before the passengers board needs to be a bit more thorough. the alcoholic drinks were all pleasant. the food was of variable quality (as was the coffee) none bad, some a bit mediocre, some good. many have commented on the somewhat odd seat arrangement and i found it a bit of a palaver to have to carefully step over another, sleeping, passenger's legs trying not to wake them up. the other problem with that configuration is the video screen has to be stowed at take off and landing which means you can't watch it, as you can in economy when the screen is on the back of the seat in front of you. on both flights i found that my screen seemed to be broken and would not lock in position so that i would have to look at it at an angle. i solved the problem by stuffing a rolled up magazine in the hinge bit, but then i had to take it out every time i got out of my seat. another problem with the configuration is that the storage space is minimal; apart from the overhead lockers there is only a small drawer. and that adds to the litter problem. after you have taken off the polythene wrappers for your headphones and blanket or the paper ring around your napkin, what do you do with it? er, drop it on the floor? i did manage to sleep quite well, though the pillow you are provided with is very thin. on the flight back they gave me another one when i asked. another small problem is that there is no individual air conditioning vent for your seat and if you take off your jacket, sweater or whatever, the lack of storage space means it has to go in the overhead locker if you have already filled up the little drawer. and i don't want to seem a bit picky, but although the in-flight entertainment has a good choice of films, the menu system for seeing what they are is a bit irritating; they are all divided into categories such as ""comedy"", ""thrillers"" etc but no a-z. all in all, it wasn't an unpleasant experience but i would advise ba, if they were interested in my advice, that they need to clean the planes more often and more thoroughly and re-think the seat configuration.",11th November 2017,United Kingdom,Business Class,yes,3,Denver to Heathrow,Family Leisure,Yes,Neutral

"heathrow to dubai. this is a warning of what to expect from british airways . if they continue to treat passengers this way i can see the airline very quickly getting into difficulty. the reply i got from the airline below just brushed all the issues i raised under the carpet. living in egypt for 10 years i became i frequent flyer with egyptair. if i wanted to change the date of travel with them they only charged me £60. ba want to charge me over £500 and because i wanted to cancel my flight and go with a better airline they were only prepared to give me a £9.50 refund even though i would have given them over 2 months notice. this airline is on my black list, makes me ashamed to think this is my national airline, but never again will i book another flight with ba. there was no priority seat booking unless i paid another £38 extra. there was no priority boarding. i booked seat 23d but this was mysteriously changed at check in to 24e. ba emailed me to confirm a change in the booking but did not say what that change was. i did not make any changes. in premium economy i was wedged in like a sardine in a seat that is only 1"" wider than economy with a few inches extra leg room. is this some kind of joke? i had to double check that i wasn't in economy as there is only one seat difference in a row. the tough chicken meal was diabolical. the cabin light over the bulkhead luggage bins was jammed on and would not go out so no sleep whatsoever. i really do not see the necessity for this light anyhow as the non smoking lights and tv screen light give emit sufficient light anyway. i ended up paying £300 extra for nothing and am extremely disappointed with this flight. a few days previously i flew premium economy with virgin atlantic return from barbados and the difference between ba and virgin is worlds apart.",2nd November 2017,United Arab Emirates,Premium Economy,no,3,BKK to LHR,Business,Yes,Negative

"shanghai to tampa via heathrow/gatwick. we received deplorable customer service recently from british airways. i purchased business class tickets on 11/28/2016 for flights on september 30, 2017. i purchased two tickets for a total of $9,676.26 plus an additional $652 for seat assignments. the problems occurred on our return flights. we were booked october 17, 2017 on ba168 shanghai to lhr  london with continuing service, october 18, 2017 from london gatwick)to tampa. we were disembarking a cruise ship at the port of shanghai on october 17, 2017. we checked in online 24 hours before our flights scheduled departure at 11:00 a.m. on the evening of october 16, 2017 the captain announced that the ship would not dock at the port as scheduled at 7:00 a.m. in the morning on october 17, the captain announced that the chinese had shut down the port and were not allowing any ships to dock. after these announcements we frantically tried to contact british airways because we expected that we would miss our 11:00 am flight. we were unable to do so. we were informed that in order to exit china without a visa, we needed to have proof of our flights leaving the country. we were aware of this requirement. we had not applied for a visa because we were only transiting from the ship to the airplane. we knew that without a visa of valid flights out, we would be escorted to the local chinese police station until we could arrange flights out of the country. for obvious reasons we did not want to experience that situation. we were able to contact a travel agent via e-mail (our phone was not operating as we were at sea in chin ). our agent was able to contact british airways and explain our situation. there was another flight that departed on october 18, which was 13 hours 40 minutes after our original flight. that was flt ba 160. we were told here are your choices: 1. pay a change fee of $884 and be down graded to premium economy on both flights, ba 160 and ba 2167 , even though we would be able to make ba 2167 as it did not depart london (lgw) until 11:55 am on october 18, 2017. 2. pay an additional $6,388 per person for a total of $12,776 to keep our business class status on both flights. (we had already paid $10,328.26 for these tickets). 3. disembark the ship and take our chances with chinese immigration. option 2 was outrageous, option 3 frightening. we felt we had no choice but to choose option 1. the travel agent advised us to explain what had happened when we arrived at the airport at check-in and request our business class seats if they were available. when we checked in at pvg we asked if there were business class seats available. “yes, several” was the response. we explained what had happened and asked as a courtesy if we could have those vacant seats. “yes, for a cost of $12,776 “. of course we refused to pay that amount. we were then charged additional baggage fees because as we had expected to be flying business class, two suitcases were over the 50 lbs limit for economy. while on board during that flight ba160, i went into the business class cabin and saw that there were indeed vacant seats. when we arrived in london we again asked to be seated in our originally purchased seats. were we on the same flight as originally scheduled, but i was informed that our business class seats had already been assigned to other flyers. apparently british airways sold our seats or an upgrade to other passengers at our expense.",28th October 2017,United States,Business Class,no,3,Gatwick to Venice,Solo Leisure,Yes,Negative
"gatwick to marrakech. generally a well organised flight and fairly full in y class. my gripe is about the current food service. this was a fairly long short-haul flight scheduled for 3h 45m in which a reasonable meal service would be welcome and desirable. after a lot of comments from others who have flown ba recently we bought food in the terminal before departure as the coho-ice on board is very limited, especially as much seems to be already 'sold out'. the biggest issue is about the time taken to do the food selling. it took almost all of the flight time for the crew to work through the plane to serve every row even though i observed that about 60% of passengers bought nothing. of course this led to problems for those wishing to go to the toilets at the rear when food service starts at the front, any passengers from front to middle have no access to aft toilets after the trolley has passed. passengers resorted to using the forward toilets passing through business class which i assume was not welcomed by those passengers. i overheard a crew member saying that they were not going to duty free sales as they were out of time. it is ridiculous that this paid and limited service takes so long. i remember the days when a british midland crew could serve a full cooked breakfast with tea or coffee to all 100 or so pax on a lhr to middlesbrough flight scheduled for 40 minutes or an aer lingus crew serving hot breakfast to all on a turbulent flight of 1 hr from dublin to london. if ba want to differentiate themselves from low cost carriers then this is not the way to do it.",27th October 2017,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,3,London to Luanda,Couple Leisure,Yes,Neutral

(true this happens in other seat classes as well but usually at a less precarious angle and generally not from behind your head!) in order to get out of the centre seats (rows e and f) and the window seats you have to climb over another passenger’s feet if they have their foot rest down and seat reclined. in the dimmed cabin lighting this is tricky and potentially dangerous; as a minimum you normally end up kicking the passenger you are climbing over. we are both able bodied but anybody less mobile would really struggle to get out into the aisle for whatever reason. you almost feel imprisoned in the centre seats and you are often also ignored because the cabin crew just pass by quickly, often from behind you so by the time you notice them, they have gone. we should not have to use a call button just to get basic service. the return leg was a night flight, the service overall was very poor, the crew just wanted to turn the lights down asap. the service at breakfast was also poor, the offerings were inconsistent. my wife struggled just to get an orange juice on her side of the cabin, whereas i at least got that but struggled to get a second cup of coffee. the entertainment system was archaic (very few recent film titles), the small screen resolution was very poor; this aircraft was delivered to ba in march 1999 and it shows its age. this flight might have been a few hundred pounds cheaper than competitors but in future we will pay the extra to get a decent seat and service. ba are only getting away with retaining these dreadful seats versus aisle access for everybody because the corporate passenger market is letting them. it is obvious if your employer is paying and says you can either choose to have an economy seat or one of those dreadful business class seats, you will obviously choose the business class seat and put up with the difficulties and poor service. it will be marginally better than being seated at the back; but that does not make it right. we will probably never fly ba long-haul business class (club world) again while we are paying for the tickets unless they stop being so arrogant and re-configure their seating!",17th October 2017,United Kingdom,Business Class,no,3,Gatwick to Venice,Solo Leisure,Yes,Negative

"flew leeds bradford to geneva via london heathrow. british airways certainly shocked me with the budget low cost style. my bag was 23.1 kg (0.1kg over the limit). this meant i had to pay for two bags whilst only having one. when i asked to take one item out and put it in my carry on to avoid paying an extra £25 or so, the answer was no, which was odd considering the bag was on the belt right infront of me. on board the aircraft boarding was prompt, a clean sleek cabin. i was seated near the back close to the toilet, which wasn't a problem. beverage service was okay, everything was over priced, i bought a ginger ale for £2 and it was a cup, which shocked me as it was advertised as a full size can. the only thing that was free on board was water, for an international service on quite an expensive ticket it was a little disappointing. the crew were friendly and helpful but i couldn't help but overhear the crews conversation in the galley on descent into switzerland. what they were talking about was inappropriate, especially how loud they were talking with children nearby. apart from those things the flight was on time, punctual and served the purpose which i paid for.",8th October 2017,New Zealand,Economy Class,yes,7,Gatwick to Venice,Solo Leisure,Yes,Neutral

"london heathrow to istanbul. british airways is quite clearly in decline and with utter contempt for its customers, even loyal ones who have status like myself. the overall feeling is of an airline that is miserly and skimping and greatly removed of the image that they try to portray of being a premium airline. galleries south in t5 is large, airy and well equipped and clean and was not too busy on the sunday i travelled. drinks are well stocked but from the catering it is evident this is an airline scraping to do the bare minimum in what it offers - the quality lacking with minuscule portions for breakfast and loading up of cheap carbs and curtailing of premium ingredients. onboard it is similarly tired, the plane had not been cleaned and my seat had food debris from the previous flight and stains on the tray table. seating is cramped. the cabin crew look dejected and have low morale. onboard experience the service is no different, than flying easyjet, in fact i would argue worse. there is no complimentary catering, you are subjected to m&s sandwiches. it is not cheap and or good value or any better than lcc offerings. service is slow and took the whole of 4.5 hours of the flight - meaning difficulty to going to the toilet due to the trolley blocking the aisle - i was even asked to wait until i was finished which is ludicrous given it took the whole flight to serve people. the slow service is due to the use of card only payment, and also the fact the supplier doesn't allow their chilled items to be on the trolley which means the ridiculous scenario of cabin crew constantly running to the galley to fetch items and further slowing it down. on the return journey its clear ba doesn't care about its european or non-north american routes - the lounge was a contract lounge which was very subpar, in fact it was dark dingy and furniture filthy, but least the food was decent. overall if it wasn't for the fact i flew with ff miles and the low tax on redemptions within europe, i would never actually pay the full cash fare for this airline - you get better more efficient service on the likes of easyjet now within europe with no difference in overall product now complimentary catering has been removed.",6th October 2017,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,5,Denver to Heathrow,Family Leisure,Yes,Neutral

(the coffee, by the way, was excellent). the return flight was worse because the trolley made it two thirds down the aisle and was getting tantalisingly close to me before abruptly stopping and returning to the galley, leaving the remaining passengers unserved. in conclusion, clean plane, punctual service, pleasant cabin crew but awful refreshment service.",21st September 2017,United Kingdom,Economy Class,yes,5,BLR to LHR,Business,Yes,Positive

"london gatwick to funchal. in my opinion british airways have got things badly wrong in the race to the bottom. for travellers in economy ba are now just another budget carrier and not a very good one at that. they have failed to understand what their true market is all about. generally if people want to use a cheap budget carrier they will use the likes of ryanair or easyjet. the ba brand has always been associated with the quality that a full service airline provides, but sadly not any more. the choice of food for sale to the economy passenger is not only poor but it's expensive. frankly it must be embarrassing for the cabin crew to make announcements saying that the business class passengers will be offered a hot meal and free drinks but all those in economy must pay. and that assumes that from the enormous range of 2 types of sandwich on offer that there will be any left. on our flights to and from funchal there was a single trolley for the entire economy cabin, in each case taking more than 2 hours to make it from the front to the back. service could only have been any slower if the crew were trying to sell scratch cards along with the overpriced food and drink! maybe that's in the next part of the ba master plan?! british airways used to be a national carrier to be proud of but these days they are just an embarrassment, not a full service airline or a decent budget carrier, simply lost somewhere in the middle. as a fairly regular traveller of many years my preference would always been to travel with my national airline but this race to the bottom is driving me away. don't ba management understand that there are many people who would gladly pay a little bit more for 'free' food and drink? sadly i think we know the answer. all we need now is a bugle playing as the plane touches down and the sad transition from world class carrier to poor budget imitator will be complete.",11th September 2017,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,3,Rome to Heathrow,Solo Leisure,Yes,Negative

"florence to bristol. a positive first experience and i will try to fly ba in the future. when i booked the flight for myself and my 11 and 13 year olds i was automatically allocated seats (no charge), 23kg of checked luggage included at no additional charge yet the flights still worked out the cheapest. a few hours before the flight, during online check-in, i noticed my daughter's name mispelt on the ticket. i telephoned ba's 24 hour helpline and the ticket was changed and reissued within an hour and i received a call back with an update part way through the process (no charge and no hassle). all staff from customer services to ground staff to in-flight crew were friendly. staff on the return flight went out of their way to try and help a young mum with an upset child. we were given a meal with water and a further drink on our 2h 20m flight. on this flight to bristol everything is included in your ticket. we had soft drinks but a couple in-front had g&ts. our meal was salmon with couscous, bread, cheese and a mint. on the way back there was a choice of falafel and couscous or chicken salad with a chocolate brownie. the meals were actually really nice. both our flights did depart late for different and, what i believe were, unavoidable reasons but we were given adequate explanations and our flight out to italy still arrived early. some explanation before boarding the return flight might have been helpful although nobody seemed concerned and it was passengers who hadn't got themselves to the gate that further held the flight up. i wasn't bothered which airline i flew with. my criteria were that i could fly from a local airport as cheaply as possible and ba came in cheaper than any of the other airlines for this particular flight. my criteria will still exist but i will certainly be looking at ba first in the future.",21st August 2017,United Kingdom,Economy Class,yes,1,BKK to LHR,Business,Yes,Positive

"toulouse to london heathrow. this airline will one day get its comeuppance for posing as a quality flag carrier (it has to be said, no expense is spared on its branding) while operating as a cheap and sleazy budget airline, thanks to the rationale of its greedy and cynical new management. i have bronze status with ba executive club, have flown a dozen times over the past year (both in business and in economy) and am increasingly irritated with myself that i chose to collect points with this particular airline. i was caught up in the it meltdown in may (flying from rhodes to london), and i was one of the lucky ones (who doesn't remember those surreal news reports of passengers stranded all over the world for 4 days?). i had to purchase a new ticket on a charter flight from rhodes airport when my flight was cancelled (along with hundreds of other ba flights in may); this (incidentally: ghastly tui) replacement flight arrived so much later than the flight i booked that i lost my pre-paid hotel booking at the airport, which the airline refused to refund when i lodged a claim. the airline only refunded me for my cancelled flight and my new flight, along with eu compensation, after i sent a second email a month after my first claim, as they simply neglected to raise a cheque for me, according to the customer agent. their customer service is beyond atrocious. i suspect they swear company oaths never to genuinely apologise for ba failings (all you get is ""bear with us, we're trying really hard""), lest actually saying sorry should incur legal liability. i am unfortunately due to fly with them again at the end of the month to belfast, and after two calls to their contact center (based in india, with a poor connection and amateur communication overall) still do not know if my travel companion will be allowed to travel on a domestic flight as a canadian citizen without a uk id document. the customer agents i spoke to gave me contradictory answers, which, in turn, run contrary to the (almost non-existent) information provided on their website. on the flights i have booked which have actually taken place, i have by turns found myself stuck along with fellow passengers on the tarmac for an hour and a half in bdx when the plane lost its takeoff spot, having waited for delayed passengers (would they admit this was their fault? nope, it was all air traffic control's fault!), been held on the tarmac in tls for an hour whilst they sorted out luggage which had mistakenly been put on our plane, retrieved a used bottle of rancid baby milk from my club seat (no apology from the flight attendant who seemed annoyed at having to handle it), sat in a seat totally encrusted in potato chips apparently used as confetti by a previous passenger and found myself wedged between totally drunken and abusive passengers in club and a scolding flight attendant threatening to have them arrested on arrival. as i mentioned, i have been one of their luckier passengers.",17th August 2017,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,3,Heathrow to Las Vegas,Family Leisure,Yes,Negative

"san diego to london heathrow. the worst business class i have flown in! i flew on the 777 so whilst it's not the newest plane in the fleet, i still expected some level of comfort. the seats are too narrow and do not lie flat. i'm a slim size 8 and could not turn around in my seat. there is a footrest that comes down to form the end of the bed, but does not line up with the rest of the seat. so your feet are raised. the armrests are narrow and hard and wobble around. every time the person next to you moves, your chair moves too. the hydraulics must be connected. it was very annoying. the tray table was not well supported and when pulled out of the arm rest, it sloped down and so drinks/meal tray did not stay put. it was not secure and basically, was flimsy and unusable. i had to use my inflatable neck pillow to support it on my lap. i was in seat 14a which was a rear facing window seat. there is a plastic divider between you and the seat next to you (which is a forward facing aisle seat). the divider has to stay down until you are airbourne. so for the first 40 minutes or so whilst the plane is boarding, you are staring a fellow passenger directly in the face. very awkward! the tv pulls out of the side column and mine wouldn't stay put. it wanted to go back into the column and so i had to watch my movie at an angle. the food. well. the fillet streak was tough and dry. i had a similar dish flying out to the states on a 777 with american airlines and they did a much better job. the selection of wines was good and the key lime pie was nice. service: if you want good service, don't get a window seat. you are cut off from the aisle, and with the plastic divider up between you and the opposite passenger, the cabin crew forget you are even there. i had to ask for a drink when the trolley went round, both with dinner and breakfast. the layout of the seats also makes it tricky for the cabin crew to pass you your drinks and food as they have go above the opposite passengers head! not ideal with some turbulence. there was also no wifi even though ba advertise as such. apparently the boeing 777 does not have the right equipment. in short, ba have obviously prioritised cramming as many small seats as possible into business class cabin. the layout is impractical, seats are narrow, there is an awkwardness with an intimate view of the fellow passenger, and the layout also means that your not clearly visible to the cabin crew and so get ignored. the 777 is an old plane and definitely needs modernising to ensure that the seats are working properly, the tv's stay out of their sockets so you can watch a movie and the tray tables can support your meal. i for one will not be flying ba business again.",31st July 2017,United Kingdom,Business Class,no,5,Rome to Heathrow,Solo Leisure,Yes,Negative
"flew british airways from pisa to london gatwick. the two of us arrived at the airport exactly two hours before departure. we had hand baggage only and had already checked-in online and had boarding cards on our smartphones so proceeded to security. the queue was pretty hectic and it took 30 minutes to get through. although we were flying economy as ba gold members we had access to the lounge. the lounge was quite dated in design but very comfortable with a good selection of food and beverage for a contract lounge. we left the lounge 45 minutes before the scheduled departure as still had to go through passport control, the queue was long and slow and took 20 minutes to get through. once through we headed to the gates which was boarding for priority passengers. we received the magic beep and were upgraded to club europe (both of us are gold members). we were seated in row 7, it was the typical 3 seats but the middle seat blocked with a tray installed. leg room not great but we are both short. after take off we were offered drinks. i had a glass of champagne which was served from a full size bottle. we were then offered afternoon tea, consisting of three finger sandwiches: beef, egg and tuna and a slice of victoria sponge cake. all very tasty but i do miss the scones in club europe. i also managed two top ups of champagne. the cabin crew were efficient and friendly enough and happy to provide extra drinks when requested. the flight arrived on time and we were on a train within 30 minutes of landing. overall we paid £50 each for the flight and with the upgrade was a bargain.",28th July 2017,United Kingdom,Business Class,yes,3,Gatwick to Venice,Solo Leisure,Yes,Positive

"this was a one way avios redemption flight. fare cost £17.50 and 7,500 avios each. as a ba gold member i used the first class wing at t5, this included direct access to the galleries first lounge. we were through very quickly as there was no queue at security. the lounge was busy and we arrived at the switch over from breakfast to lunch. the former had better food offering, the sausages and mushrooms very tasty. lunch wasn't very good, i ordered a ba burger, the chips were the best part but only five were given on the plate, my wife ordered the aranchini which was awful and tasteless - she left most of it. the buffet selection wasn't particularly interesting, some chicken, potatoes, veggie curry and chilli. my wife said the curry was okay but the chilli i tried was bland. the drinks on offer were decent, a gin festival was on, although i don't drink the stuff the choice looked extensive. i had a few glasses of henriot champagne which was okay better than the awful castlenau they used to have but not as good as the taittinger they served a year ago. i tried a few sips of a kiwi pinot gris, can't remember what it was called but it was very nice. finally i couldn't resist a shot of johnnie walker blue. the first class lounge itself needs some tlc, the gents are smelly and unkept and none of the plug sockets worked. i normally try to fly another oneworld airline other than ba. but if it has to be ba then i prefer to fly from t3 for the excellent cathay pacific lounge. in fact i prefer the new ba gatwick first lounge than the galleries t5. the flight itself was okay, it pushed back slightly late and arrived at bologna on time. i didn't bother with the bob as had eaten in the lounge and was saving myself for dinner in bologna. cabin crew seemed friendly enough and spent quite a long time selling the bob offering. we sat in a pair of two seats next to door 3l. really appreciated just two seats without any neighbours on the almost full flight. due to our seat position in the plane and the fact both front and rear doors were used for deplaning, we were one of the last passengers to exit. it was a short bus ride to the terminal and it took 20 minutes to get though passport control then a further 30 minute wait for our luggage. despite a lot of moans about ba on this forum i can't really complain about the overall experience. as a gold member the lounge access was free. but if i paid full premium fare to access the lounge then yes i'd be disappointed.",25th July 2017,United Kingdom,Economy Class,yes,7,Heathrow to Las Vegas,Family Leisure,Yes,Positive
"we did a return trip from heathrow to jfk and there were only two good things about flying british airways, you can use the entertainment system from the start and we liked terminal five at heathrow. the rest was disappointing. the outbound flight was completely full so it was delayed in departing, you would expect them to have known this so they would be able to prepare and ensure that the flight left on schedule. there was no apology. the return trip was also late in departing but was quicker than expected so cannot complain. there was only one inflight meal and the only other offering was a bag of crisps or an 18g chocolate bar. it felt like being in school. cabin crew weren't overly friendly on either journey. inflight entertainment was fine, lots of films both new and old to watch. we would usually fly emirates or virgin but decided to fly ba to give it a go. if you have similar thoughts, don't do it. we won't be flying with ba again, they are not worth it. it is very british - elitist and inefficient.",24th July 2017,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,3,Rome to Heathrow,Solo Leisure,Yes,Positive

"london to hong kong in premium economy. i have been flying ba on my many trips over the last six years, and i have seen such a shocking decline in their services that i feel compelled to write this review. of my six flights this year, three were seriously delayed. one was from oslo to london on 9th june, when the captain decided to wait  for some business class passengers who hadn't made their way out of the lounge in time for take-off. my worst experience, however, was going to hong kong on 30th may, when there was a technical fault with the plane. the captain decided to board passengers at the scheduled time, who then sat on the plane for almost three hours, without being offered any water or other refreshments, and with little information and apologies, before an 11-hour flight. i was in premium economy, but the extra amount i paid did not offer any additional comfort. i switched my seat to help a disabled passenger and ended up in a seat next to the toilets, which meant that i got no rest during the night. how can premium economy seats be next to the toilet? the in-flight service was poor, as nobody came around to offer water or beverages during the night. i am still wondering why anybody would pay for premium economy, as it is just a lousy offer: seats are only marginally more spacious than in economy (but don't recline as they would in economy), the food is the same, which means rather bad, and the flight attendants are clearly not interested in offering service beyond the first two hours of the flight. predictably, the plane landed in hong kong just in time (below three hours' delay) for the airline avoiding to have to pay compensation to passengers on this very uncomfortable flight. i had hoped to have a better experience on the return flight on 4th june, but then i found out that ba had scrapped the sparkling wine as a welcome drink for premium economy passengers. although this time the flight was on time, this gave me such a bad feeling about ba, their cynical attitude towards their passengers and their meanness. i will look for alternative airlines from now on and would recommend to avoid flying with ba.",5th July 2017,United Kingdom,Premium Economy,no,5,London to Sydney,Couple Leisure,Yes,Negative

"leeds to durban via london / johannesburg. check in at leeds was efficient. security was slow, so fast track was appreciated. boarding was relatively quick and flight departed early. seating was reasonably comfortable but cramped, and service is basically non existent unless one is prepared to pay for food. transfer at heathrow was a breeze, surprisingly with no further security check. boarding commenced in good time and was quick and smooth onto the upper deck, with a pleasant greeting from the crew. the premium economy cabin is very pleasant with good seat width and legroom. the seats are comfortable, but both our seats were faulty. mine would not stay upright and my wife's would not recline. unfortunately we did not realise the extent of the problem immediately and only reported it next morning. we were moved to business class - we should have reported it immediately! sparkling wine and fruit juice were offered before take off, unfortunately the quality has been hit by cost savings. bar service followed quickly after take off, but again the quality of wines was average and not up to the standard offered by other airline in premium economy. we both ordered beef fillet for dinner - alternative was chicken - which was good and served on proper crockery with decent cutlery. breakfast next morning was economy class fare with plastic cutlery, which along with the cheap and nasty amenity kit lets down the standard and one questions whether the cost saving is really worth the negative impression created. the a380 is very quiet and most passengers seemed to sleep. there were several drink runs during the night, and the cabin crew were quite active. arrival was on time and everything went smoothly. the final connection to durban with ba franchise, comair, was a reminder of the difference between flying in south africa and flying in europe. more space and full service on a one hour flight.",24th June 2017,South Africa,Premium Economy,yes,3,Rome to Heathrow,Solo Leisure,Yes,Positive

"this was my first flight from toronto to london crewed by ""mixed fleet"". easy check-in at toronto pearson (the ba ground staff are always great in toronto) with fast track meant i was in the lounge 20 mins after arriving at the airport. the lounge remains well run with ok food and a limited (average) wine list. still too few bathrooms, the seats are tatty, and when busy is not a relaxing place to be. easy boarding and the first of a few improvements - prosecco now served to london. (used to be only ex london). fast drinks service after take off with pretzels now back on offer. an ok chicken curry was served but i still don't see it as biz class food. a choice of whites and reds wine was offered which reinstates the previous one of each. that is where the improvements ended. the morning offering of a cereal bar and t&cs / juice remains an insult and just shows how little ba care about the entire journey customer experience. the crew on this flight were great. young, junior and inexperienced for sure but the two women working my side were friendly and professional. a request for a top up of prosecco was missed due to a short taxi, but appeared (in glass) without asking as soon as the crew were released - classy and well remembered! the return flight was less good. drinks served promptly after take off and my pre-booked meal arrived first but on the wrong tray. (crew member's first flight since qualifying) it took some convincing that the plastic cutlery etc was not a wtp tray. the underwhelming snack replacing the second meal was one fun size piece of chocolate and t&c. customers taking a second chocolate were made to put it back (really) as apparently they are counted out to the exact number of passengers. this cut to service on both legs continues to leave me troubled as after 5 hours i need something more substantial than chocolate. service reduced - yes, price reduced - no! the 777's in both directions were clean though unless you sit in the first row of wtp, the ife screens are tiny. mixed fleet were generally more friendly and interested in making an effort. however, the male crew were more aloof, lacked attention to detail and officious. what these (newer) crews miss, was the more informal / laid back service of long haul crew - i hope they relax into the role soon! at least the cuts have stopped (not much left to cut i admit) and small things like choice of wine and pretzels show ba have listened. however, the second meal in both directions being cut on east coast us / canada routes remains a sore on what was otherwise an ok journey. the jury remains out on whether i continue my loyalty to ba and one world - it really depends on what ba do next - to either value me as a customer (and offer a quality service) or sink even lower in standards from what was once a great airline (at which point - i'm off).",19th June 2017,Canada,Premium Economy,no,3,BLR to LHR,Business,Yes,Positive

"i am a frequent flyer with british airways, having held silver membership for years. on this instance, i flew ba's short-haul business class. while you're essentially in the same cabin as everyone else, you should get a meal onboard (something i had counted on) and the seat next to you should be left empty. i fly this route around once every other week, but have been ba to long-haul destinations (hong kong, beijing, nyc, d.c. and san francisco) several times a year, my experience on this flight tallies with the other flights i have taken this year on the same and other routes. the aircraft came in late, which is a common occurrence with ba these days. except for me, nobody in business class had an empty seat next to them. we were then informed by the overworked and tired flight attendant that no food had been delivered, although we 'might be' able to obtain food vouchers once we get to lcy. in short, the product was exactly the same as economy class but at an added premium of at least the price of your regular economy ticket. this was complemented by slow and unfriendly check-in staff, an old aircraft, and a good hour i had spent on the phone with unaccountable and disinterested ba customer service to work out if the online upgrade had gone through. on the whole, a number of instances that simply add up make me feel that ba is very much going in the wrong direction. they might be cheap, but can't and shouldn't compete with low-cost carriers or indeed asian airlines that have lower overhead costs.",11th June 2017,United Kingdom,Business Class,no,9,London to Tampa,Couple Leisure,Yes,Negative

"i am shocked about how the first class on board service has deteriorated with very evident cost cutting on what is supposed to be our national flag carrier. on our flight to tokyo narita from london heathrow we were advised by the cabin crew soon after take off that the catering supplies loaded were 'limited'. to cut a long story short, this meant that my partner, who was the last to be served, was told what was available rather than asked what he would like. this is in spite of there being only 5 passengers in the 8 seat cabin. for breakfast prior to landing, we were informed that only two cooked breakfasts were available so it would be first come first served. the presentation of the food that was available was poor & certainly not worthy of the fine dining description ba uses for its first class catering. we spoke to the cabin services manager who was extremely apologetic & confirmed that there has been cost cutting - apparently at the behest of the new ceo who comes from low cost sister airline vueling, with a resultant increase in unhappiness & complaints from passengers. the famous first class tasting menu we enjoyed on previous flights is now gone & other cost cutting around on board service is very evident - even the rose in the first class toilet was dead which really epitomises the lacklustre airline that ba has become. i fly regularly long haul with klm & their new business class offering is now far superior to ba's first. how can our national airline, with whom we should be proud to fly, compete with other superior european & gulf carriers when the emphasis seems to be only on never ending cost cutting that now affects even the most premium passengers? the cabin services manager entered a formal complaint on our behalf from on board on 3 may. almost a month later, although immediately acknowledged, ba have not responded, probably due to more administrative cost cutting. i should add that the ground service at heathrow t5 & the concorde room were very good but as regards on board service, ba offends their premium passengers like this at their peril.",2nd June 2017,United Kingdom,First Class,no,5,London to Luanda,Couple Leisure,Yes,Negative

"choose a budget airline, the magic of our national carrier has gone. we have always chosen british airways as our preferred carrier where possible and happy to pay a higher premium for the once great service but now it's on par or lower than other low cost carriers. firstly we didn't get any priority boarding with our two young children. easyjet provides this. secondly, we reserved seats as travelling with our two children, they both fight for who is going to sit at the windows. on boarding we were told the plane has changed, therefore we now had assigned seats. thirdly, after paying over £10 for two small alcoholic drinks for me and my wife i needed the loo, first class was out of bounds. so the only option the rear of the plane, however the crew were busy serving and not prepared to move to allow me past (i guess those drinks they were selling had the ba executive team seeing many ££££ so me being a customer needing the loo was second in priority). after a long period they moved to the rear to allow me past, but once out they had gone back to the middle of the plane. a crew member at the back galley even laughed and said your not getting back and therefore fairly offered me a free cup of tea. our flight from heathrow to bergen was only an hour and 40, but i spent the majority in the rear galley chatting with the said crew member. the return flight the cabin crew had as much enthusiasm as my 80 year old grandmother and technology. the safety briefing came over a tannoy that would have sounded half decent in 1973 and to top it off, the lead steward whilst taxiing for takeof, asked the crew - ""cabin crew, seats for landing"". the captain gave us an update on takeoff and then radio silence for the rest of the flight, even upon landing he stood at the front having a chat with the said steward as we disembarked about how some machine must have come to life with 'that landing'. all minor points, but they were the points we enjoyed with ba, points that made us choose them, small points that made the difference. the pilots at the end of the flight welcoming or thanking the customer and us thanking them, the cabin crew that always went over and beyond. the free drinks that made us feel special to ask and get, i'd rather pay a premium for all that or choose a budget airline. gutted our british airways national carrier has become a budget airline. perhaps cost savings are needed, but for now, although we are a minor factor and small fry in the bigger picture, they need to cost save some more to make up our future tickets and my recommendations are now also dead. for me their usp was their service, without that there is no longer a point.",30th May 2017,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,3,London to Tampa,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive
"london heathrow to seoul return. i booked my return flights back in january when ba were having their annual sale for around £1700. thought this was a bargain as they are usually up around £3000. london to seoul flight was very pleasant. didn't get to use the business class lounge in heathrow as my connection from manchester was delayed by 40 minutes. cabin crew on the actual flight were excellent and very attentive. food and drink was what you would expect of most business class airlines with a decent amount of high-quality menu choices. the seat layout of 2-3-2 with seats facing in the opposite direction to each other and a divider between them felt a little bit cramped. the seats were very comfortable and went flat which is better than some, however there is a fold-down seat/step in front of you that you have to use to able to stretch out fully. i'm 6'0 and found i was at my limit of being able to stretch out fully so anyone taller than that would probably be a bit uncomfortable. inflight entertainment had a decent range of tv and films to choose from including some of the more recent releases. toilets were also smaller and more cramped than on other airlines that i've flown business class with before. the only let down was that the cabin itself was hotter than the sun and i found it difficult to sleep because of this. seoul to london was what really let ba down for me and left a sour note on what was an amazing 3 months in korea. in the days leading up to the flight, ba's ""massive it failure"" and the lack of information and help surrounding it meant i was having to frantically check if my flight would be leaving at all, with the flights on the 27th and 28th being cancelled completely. luckily they got it sorted in the early hours of the morning on the day of the flight. the flight and cabin crew arrived late for the flight and so take-off was delayed by 30 minutes. i had a connecting flight to catch to manchester so it was imperative that everything went smoothly as i had just over an hour after landing to make it. the flight was lovely with the cabin crew doing an amazing job. the pilots managed to make up for lost time and so we ended up landing 5 minutes earlier than scheduled. however, due to the backlog of delayed and cancelled flights from the past couple of days, there was another flight in the space where mine was supposed to park. this meant a delay of 20 minutes while we waited on the tarmac for the space to become free. this was time i could not afford to lose. we eventually disembarked at 14:45 which meant i had to sprint through the airport to passport control and to the baggage reclaim. really wish i hadn't as it still took 20 minutes for the bags to come off the plane. by the time i had done all this and gone through arrivals it was 15:15 and the gate was closing in 10 mins. talked to ba customer services and got rebooked on another flight back to the iom (where i live) from london city but they could only book me on the 14:50pm flight the next day. wasn't at all happy with the experience overall because of this and for what you would normally pay (over £3,000 when not on sale) it really wasn't worth the hassle for me personally.",30th May 2017,United Kingdom,Business Class,no,1,London to Sydney,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

"rome to london. thursday may 18 flight scheduled to leave at 1200 delayed due to technical issues for 6 hrs and then cancelled at 1730. this caused missed connecting flight to los angeles. very poor communication with passengers by desk attendants. no one took charge of our situation, information filtered through italian speaking passengers who sought help with staff from iberia airlines. ba staff was gone after 6pm and we were shuttled to hotel and told a rep would give us further information at hotel. no one from ba was seen or heard from at hotel. multiple calls by passengers to ba resulted in little to no assistance. friday, may 19 passengers are shuttled back to airport where chaos has broken out because there is little assistance once again at ba counter. after 1 hour in line i obtain a boarding pass on a flight to london with connection to los angeles, however the ba desk attendant informs me that the flight out of rome is late due to technical issues and i will once again miss the flight out to la. i'm appalled at the lack of educated, experienced ba assistance! ba abandoned us at rome airport. in addition there web site is of no help. flight information was outdated and impossible to this day to reach customer contact.",27th May 2017,United States,Economy Class,no,5,BKK to LHR,Business,Yes,Negative

"antigua to gatwick. check in at the new terminal was quick and efficient (better than gatwick) and although we had a slight delay at immigration, we were soon airside. the new lounge was really comfortable and although we didn't use it (it was dark when we were there) they have an excellent sky terrace with loungers and shaded sofa's etc. the bar was manned by helpful staff with a small but tasty selection of food. boarding was on time. on board it was soon evident that the interior of the plane had seen better days with my wife's tv nearly falling off its mounting. fortunately she was able to position it during the flight so that it stayed in place but it was quite precarious. push back and departure was exactly on time. within a short time the crew started the evening service and this is where it all seemed quite strange. unlike the flight out, where there was a more relaxed atmosphere, the crew seemed to feel there was a need to rush whatever they were doing to the point that some of them were literally running down the aisles. the food was hurriedly delivered to us and was disappointingly under seasoned and pretty tasteless. i can only assume that the object of their haste was to get everyone fed and watered and bedded down as quickly as possible. to be quite honest i felt like we were being looked after by a nanny and told to go to bed early and i almost expected them to say 'i want you to go to sleep now and i don't want to here a sound out any of you until the morning'! now i know that the crew are all entitled to their breaks etc, but at the end of the day (or night) they are working and are getting paid to do so. in my opinion if they just slowed down a little and had more time for the passengers, it would improve the flight considerably. breakfast was ok although i seemed to be the only person trying the bacon rolls and after one mouthful i understood why. in a blind tasting i probably would have guessed i was eating rubber bands. we arrived on time and after quite a long walk to immigration and the baggage reclaim, our cases were waiting for us. overall very disappointing and based on this flight i would not recommend ba.",16th May 2017,United Kingdom,Business Class,no,5,BKK to LHR,Business,Yes,Positive

"london to santiago de chile. surprisingly pleasing flight onboard boeing 787, decided to give it a try to a rear facing business class window seat and discovered the b787 is - or looks - far lighter and wider than any b777 i've been travelling on (could be larger windows or the fuselage shape which makes the ""cocoon"" look less cramped). even the seat looks wider, while the ife screen is wider with a higher resolution. the odd ""ying-yang"" layout is slightly better on boeing 787 as the central rows do not have the honeymoon seats, therefore you won't share such a narrow space with a stranger in case you end up there. so first impression better than usual; unfortunately the soft product remains way below par (i pre-ordered the main dish of the meal which this time was actually available, but the beef was overcooked and chewy), i will never stop mentioning that the amenity kit is simply ridiculous - sort of a blue shoe bag, too small to fit shoes though. the crew very friendly but slightly less attentive than usual. overall the experience was better than usual - mainly thanks to a newer, quieter aircraft - but ba is not improving where they should, in those details that make business class something worth eur3,000 spent. still no wi-fi on ba. not commenting the ying-yang layout, which remains a mystery to me (who approved such a nonsense?).",13th May 2017,Italy,Business Class,no,7,Rome to Heathrow,Solo Leisure,Yes,Positive

"buenos aires to london. i was warned that ba had gone downhill, but i decided to give it a try on this long haul flight. to start with, you cannot reserve your seat prior to check-in, unless after paying over 2000€ for a business class ticket you are willing to spend some additional 90€ per leg to have your seat reserved. i call this insane, to be honest. so i waited and waited and waited till check-in opened, and made it to get a forward facing aisle seat. latam lounge in buenos aires was nice, food average but connecting from santiago i had the time to take a shower, with ground crew extremely nice and attentive. boarding was sort of a mess, as ba let frequent flyers (not flying business) board through the business class door, so there was a flood of people moving back and forth to get to the rear of the plane; crew simply unable to handle this process, so you did not feel like being taken care of during boarding. aircraft was a 3-class boeing 777-300 and looked a bit ""tired"". seat was the absolute worst part of this flight, as it is narrow, too hard to have a nice sleep, and for aisle passengers this configuration feels like having a ""wall"" on one side and being exposed to people/trolleys passing through the aisle on the other side; once flat it is a little short too (even for me, i'm 180cm high, no giant here) and narrow so you find yourself forced to sleep on a side; in addition to that when you lie down the drawer is not accessible, therefore you have literally no space to store anything, not even your glasses if you wear them. food was just ok (i still can't understand how ba can run out of entrée options in business class), crew very mature for such a long trip but friendly and nice, it really shows they are suffering from these cost cuts as they keep apologizing for everything that is not available or not working. entertainment system made me smile a bit, as the selection of movies was ok but the screen was much smaller than some other carrier economy class ones. to sum up, it was an average flight, if it was not for the lie-flat seat i would call it more a premium economy experience than a business one. ba needs to improve business class as they are well below par if compared to almost all european carriers, not even to compare the middle east airlines.",22nd April 2017,Italy,Business Class,no,5,Heathrow to Las Vegas,Family Leisure,Yes,Positive

""only two were loaded"", was the reply. ""what; two only, for the whole of club?"". ""yes"". i asked what else was on board, only to be told that i would have to pay £3 for an m & s sandwich from economy. before some help from our avios, the tickets cost £500.00. it was beyond belief that an executive card holder should be treated this way. the (very nice) cabin crew were excruciatingly embarrassed. ba should wake up before once loyal passengers swallow hard (pun) and migrate to other carriers. i'd rather fly easyjet and spend the £300 change on a nice meal.",21st April 2017,United Kingdom,Business Class,no,1,Denver to Heathrow,Family Leisure,Yes,Neutral

"washington to london heathrow return. british airways seems to be having an identify crisis. are they a full service or a low cost carrier? the meals have been cut back to almost nothing. seat selection fees abound. and checked baggage fees may apply, depending upon the the type of ticket purchased. united airlines now has a better trans-atlantic coach product than ba. food: on the outbound overnight flight, breakfast has been reduced to a granola bar. on the return flight, dinner was tiny. small amounts of food in half-filled bowls, presented on a large tray, as if to emphasize the lack of food. and the pre-landing snack has been replaced with the aforementioned granola bar. given the lack of food, ba should just switch to buy-on-board, so at least fewer people would go hungry. flight crews seemed apologetic about the lack of food. seat fees: i don't know of any other ""full service"" carrier that will not assign a seat in advance as part of a paid ticket. just assume it will cost you another $40 or more per ticket on ba. luggage fees: completely opaque policy. on our outbound trip, we were told our tickets included one free checked luggage item. on our return we were told checked bags would be extra, although the kindly baggage check-in attendant waived the fee for us (no doubt, he too is as much a victim of ba's indecipherable baggage fee policy as are passengers). entertainment: boeing 777-200 outbound with good, modern, on-demand ife system. on the return a boeing 747-400, the system was an older on-demand system, with small blurry screens that were almost unwatchable. cabin crews were generally friendly. in fairness, both our flights were on time and nothing went wrong. but ba just feels cheap and stingy. will likely fly the competition in the future.",19th April 2017,United States,Economy Class,no,3,London to Sydney,Couple Leisure,Yes,Neutral

"i had to change my flight back from san diego because of an accident that required a stay in hospital. i'd flown out first class and had a business class return. i do understand why some fare structures mean that flights are not changeable, but ba were absolutely no help at all. they flatly refused to change the flight so i had to buy a ticket in the only available class - world traveller plus. which cost $3,300 - one way. the first class fight to was ok - nice cabin crew and good food, but grubby cabin and clear cost cutting - no snacks, water etc in the galley like there used to be. absolutely no help on the return trip - despite requests before the flight - because i was walking with a stick. i'd requested an aisle seat, had to ask again at check in as they had given me a seat in the middle which would have really annoyed other passengers as i tried to get across them to go to the loo etc with my stick. really poor value at $3,300 and rubbish seats, uncomfortable and tv screens that aren't great. the food was awful - clear that costs are being cut massively. maybe their plan is to offer such rubbish food that when they introduce food you have to buy in long haul we all feel grateful! it's a pity really. it's obviously bas call if they want to be a no-frills airline, but i'd rather they were honest with us so that we can choose amongst the many other no frills airlines. but they keep trying to say that ba is a leading brand with strong values when clearly they've decided to cut costs wherever they can but still charge high prices. might make them profitable to be a follower in the short term but i suspect people will vote with there feet and fly with someone else.",12th April 2017,United Kingdom,Premium Economy,no,9,London to Sydney,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive
"philadelphia to edinburgh via heathrow in january 2017. i've always enjoyed flying british airways and usually make my yearly trips to philly with them rather than flying direct to newark via united. the long haul flight was ok - food service was a wee bit slow but it was the usual chicken and rice which was ok for an economy class flight. however, it was a surprise to me that they no longer served breakfast or even a snack in the morning - so the chicken was the only food we got on the flight. i wasn't too fussed about that, until i got on my connecting flight to edinburgh where i found out that they no longer served free food! by this point, i was pretty hungry so i caved in and got ready to pay for a bacon roll, which never happened because the trolly never reached me! to top it all off, we left heathrow late because of a computer problem, meaning i missed my train connection in edinburgh - but i understand that these things happen at times. however, recent cuts to service and the upcoming densification of the long and short haul fleet make ba a lot less attractive. furthermore, the headphone jack on my ife was loose so it was quite difficult to watch films during the flight, which was disappointing. on the up side, the staff both at the desk and during the flight were great as always. considering i got the flight for a good price, it was ok. although i will definitely not be going out my way to fly ba and will just go for the cheapest or direct option in future. i'm indifferent in recommending flying with ba - if they suit you best, then go ahead. but don't go out your way to fly them - if there are cheaper or direct options, just go for them instead because there isn't anything particularly outstanding.",11th April 2017,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,7,LHR to CPT,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

"i am just sad to have to write this review. i changed from lufthansa to british airways more then 10 years ago, because it beening a premium airline that was superior in any way. mostly flying between berlin, the us and in recent years very frequently cape town. ba had more modern planes, innovative products like a great (rather new) first class, lie-flat seats in business class, a new premium economy and a very good economy with good seats and legroom. flying from cape town to berlin in january to keep my silver status made me realise, that none of my initial reasons to choose ba still exists, with the exception of the great cabin staff, that i feel really sorry for. the owners hired álex cruz last year, a very experienced low-cost airline executive and he is doing the best he can: turning ba into a low-cost carrier. unfortunately. the result is a pity. no more service on short haul flights, reduced service, only paid snacks on long-haul, worn 747's to cape town and the grimm outlook to be traveling in cramped in 777's with and extra seat squeezed in from next year onwards. british airways as a premium airline is lost. realistically for year to come. even with my status renewed, i don't think i will fly them again if i don't have to. meanwhile i understand, that companies sometimes unterstand and correct their mistakes. i do hope ba will do so in the hopefully not to distant future - and keep their great staff on ground and on board.",7th April 2017,Germany,Premium Economy,no,3,BKK to LHR,Business,Yes,Positive
"no, no, no, british airways. you've messed up. someone sat in an office thought it would be a good idea to charge for food and drink on flights, just like many other airlines do, and they said ""let's provide food from m&s: that will make our offering classier than the rest."" the problem on my 18:55 flight from marrakech to london was that — it being dinner time — loads of passengers wanted food and drink, so the service was inevitably snail-paced. a piece of friendly advice, ba, you need to provide 4 cabin crew to handle economy on a dinnertime flight, or you merely annoy your customers. sitting near the back of the plane, my wife and i got served 2 hours into the 3.5 hour flight, by which time our tongues were hanging out. but what's this? only two sandwiches left, and we bagged the last two packets of crisps. you're promising things you can't deliver, ba. there is such as thing as advertising standards, and your beautifully photographed food and drinks menu drives a coach and horses through the principles of advertising standards. the 2 cabin crew serving economy soldiered on with their service most impressively, even managing to smile as for the umpteenth time someone's payment card failed to register on their machine. (hint for frequent flyers: if your card just doesn't work you get your food and drink for free.) meanwhile, behind the service trolley, a phalanx of passengers with their legs tightly crossed tried to avoid exhorting the cabin crew to move their trolley so they could access the toilets to relieve themselves (a very appropriate expression in the circumstances). other passengers simply wanted to relieve themselves of the packaging of the food they bought hours earlier: several of them eventually came down the aisle waving their empty bottles and m&s extensive food packaging for the crew to remove from their sight. whoever at british airways is employed to read reviews on this website, please take note and pass it on to your management if you dare. the process i call 'ryanisation' of british airways is almost complete. you now charge for checked baggage (yes, i know that's indirect, but only idiots can't see through the scam), you exert an extortionate price for those unfortunate enough to be tall, and who need the legroom of emergency exit seats, and now you've devised a marvellous system of charged cabin service for food and drink on 'short haul' (what even ba used to call 'medium haul') flights that annoys more than half the customers on board the plane. oh, and by the way: why don't the cabin crew deploy the a320 overhead monitors that display the flight progress? too costly, perhaps? i suggest that ba needs to return to the days of advertising when you had a wonderful slogan, but with a minor revision: ""british airways, the world's least favourite airline"".",7th April 2017,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,3,London to Tampa,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive
"having only flown easyjet / ryanair for all my short-haul journeys over the last 10 years or so, i was pleased to see a relatively low-cost ba flight for my round trip from london to rome. in hindsight, i wish i'd booked a different airline and not booked ba based on its legacy reputation. to say that this was a disappointing experience would be an understatement. i expected, at the very least, an equivalent service to that of other low-cost short-haul airlines, certainly not worse. narrow seats are to be expected but these seemed far more narrow than the norm. regardless of this, there is no excuse for a seat being so uncomfortable. even on a 2.5hr trip this was almost unbearable coupled with the fact that, at a relatively small 5""8, my knees were grazing the seat in front. lucky the seats had no recline feature to make matters worse. i was also tantalised by the ba bragging of m&s supplied food. i am more than happy to pay for this on a short-haul flight and don't expect anything for free. it certainly looked delicious from the pictures and descriptions. sadly, being sat in row 22, this meant that after the frustratingly slow pace of the cabin crew finally getting to me meant that they had run out of pretty much everything. no sandwiches, no fruit salad, no yoghurt. i asked what they did have. their response 'bottle of water or a kit kat'. after asking the cabin crew why there was so little option their response was surprising to say the least. 'they never give us enough food. it's mad. they give us 6 sandwiches for the whole flight'. needless to say that ba can no longer live on their past reputation. they had an opportunity to position themselves as the best of the low-cost carriers. sadly, they probably sit about 4th or 5th down the list. i'd say i'd give their long-haul a chance but after this experience, i won't bother. what a shame.",6th April 2017,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,1,London to Sydney,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

"toronto to berlin via london on miles in a mix of classes. first class check in at toronto was good with friendly staff. a fast priority security lane had me in the first lounge in 15 mins. unfortunately first lounge was full (of gold card members) and so had to sit in the biz lounge. good menu to eat on the ground and decent selection of wine and beers. fast boarding once it started and greeted at the door and taken to 2a. excellent rose champagne served by friendly and professional crew. a weird but tasty starter of a cured / dried salmon followed by steak which was well cooked. good cheeses and all courses selected were available. after some decent sleep, a fast breakfast served as late as possible ended a decent flight. t5 north lounge was packed with a 20 min wait for a shower which are now looking tatty and dirty. decent breakfast selection of hot rolls, fruit, cereals etc. quick board for the flight to berlin. ridiculous leg room -at 30 inches max. very cramped. don't like the table in the middle and several couples asked for them to be removed. an ok snack of cold meats though stingy portions. on time arrival and fast bags finished off a good and cramped outward leg. returning to london in economy was possibly the worst short haul flight ever (including low cost airlines). a full a321 was cramped, insufficient bins (with one out of service) and the now infamous terrible leg room.(i understand this is to get even worse when ba moves to 180 pax on an a320 in line with charter and low cost carriers. slow food and drink service with little take up. some couldn't buy as no cash accepted. not even juice, water and coffee offered for free. this penny pinching denying you even a glass of water makes the us and canadian carriers look high class. the only saving grace were great crew who were embarrassed by the product they had to deliver. the whole plane looked fed up, subdued and just waiting for the hell to finish. final leg to toronto on a 777 included a bus mystery tour to a remote stand. nice crew who were efficient and offered decent service. poor lunch of roast chicken, weird mash and overcooked greens. not biz class food and pretty average. (more like economy food). afternoon tea was fine, with a fast deplaning and bags. on the long haul legs, the ife was identical to christmas, poor choice, little new material - clearly even the ife is now down graded. the biz class product - once cutting edge is in urgent need of a revamp if only to get rid of the 8 across and lack of privacy. how the mighty have fallen! experiencing four classes on four legs, showed the gulf in all classes between ba and competitors on both short and long haul. the short haul legs to / from berlin are worse than budget airlines where at least you know what you're getting and it's reflected in the fare and extras. with less leg room, fewer toilets, reduced quality and/or no refreshments, and a general downgrading of service, the only thing not reduced is the price. this suggests that the ba exec and iag only care about the bottom line and not the customer or reputation of a once world class airline. the only thing left to strip customers of is the exec club and avios. it's only a matter of time before this final nail in the ba coffin hits the customer at which point - i'm off! hello star alliance!",24th March 2017,Canada,Business Class,no,3,London to Luanda,Couple Leisure,Yes,Negative

"mumbai to seattle via london heathrow. i don't know why i chose to fly ba - a sense of nostalgia i think. going to india this time, i decided to go east, via lhr and ba seemed a good idea. i will not do so again. i specifically booked all the flights through ba so as to avoid any issues with transitions between carriers e.g. having to pick up baggage en route. the non ba flights were arranged (i discovered subsequently) with non-partnered airlines, with no instructions or pnr's - trying to find out what the pnr was in order to get a boarding pass was an adventure as ba checkin staff kept referring me to the next leg of the flight. ""we can't give you a boarding pass - its not a ba partnered airline"" - ""but ba did all the booking!"". blank look and total non-helpfulness. ""try in heathrow"". i eventually phoned and got the pnr and checked myself in with a boarding pass. similarly on the way back, there was no instruction to the point that ba wanted me to confirm my bags in mumbai before getting on the lhr flight. when i got to the gate, the ba staff pulled me to the side and castigated me for not confirming my bags. the fact that no-one told me to do so seemed to be lost on them. essentially despite ba being the travel agent here, it seems to be all the customers responsibility to know what to do. the flights out were not too bad - fairly empty business class, and staff were accordingly attentive, aside from the fact that they never had my first meal choice. on the way back - forget it. firstly - no overhead luggage space because it was filled with ba stuff - it wasn't the 'for airline use only' at the front - it was row 11! when i asked them to shift that, i was met with resentful suggestions that i could find space elsewhere on the plane. i was pretty firm but polite on the point that having paid for business class, i did not expect to have to go searching for space because they had gear above my seat - and that i wanted them to shift their gear and provide me convenient overhead baggage space. done with bad grace. they then essentially ignored me for the rest of the flight - an overnight request for a cup of tea (i skipped dinner to sleep) took 20 mins. the breakfast was truly awful - one of the worst airline meals i have ever had. the seats are tight - i endorse all the concerns of the 2-4-2 configuration. i'm 6 ft 5, but keep myself fit and i'm not fat. i have flown around the world in multiple business seats and the ba version is honestly the worst and most uncomfortable. yes, its flat - but its short, and tight, and lumpy! lufthansa, ethihad, emirates, singapore, eva, thai, cathay pacific - all do much better than this - even delta and american airlines internationals are much better. generally, the ba experience is unhelpful, uncomfortable and shabby. i'm embarrassed to have my birth nation offer such mediocre services. its not because they are so much cheaper than others. finally, i'm now sitting in one of the ba lounges at terminal 5, and noting that the provision of breakfast is geared towards buns, porridge, and muesli. what happened to the cooked breakfasts they offered four years ago?

"lisbon to london heathrow. now that ba have started charging for all food and drink on short haul flights, they might as well rebrand to a budget airline. over the last few years, leg room across european flights (business and economy class) has decreased, to the point where it now practically the same as any budget airline. that said, it is in practice worse than budget airlines, because at least the main budget carriers have done the decent thing of removing the seat recline button, eliminating further discomfort. even without the seat in front reclined, anyone taller than 5' 8"" will be packed in tightly on any european short-haul flight. the staff are friendly and polite. however, they are often struggling to pass through the whole economy cabin with drinks/food sales service, especially when the plane is full and the flight is under 2hours 30mins. this does not only result in thirsty / hungry customers, but also the almost permanent presence of the service trolleys in the aisle blocking access to the toilets. business class (which i sometimes use) is offered a free meal and drinks, all of a reasonable quality. however, in terms of legroom / seat size there is no benefit compared to economy. the only reason i continue to fly ba is because i have fairly set routes and ba generally fly at times which suit me. otherwise, i get little in the way of added value. the benefits of avios points and moving up membership tiers are hardly worth it (in monetary terms), particularly if one mostly flies within europe. it is much cheaper to get a lounge membership (many are valid for most european - and beyond - airports), rather than remain loyal to ba these days. i have been flying with ba for well over a decade now, on a monthly basis. my sympathies go to the staff, because i fear cost-cutting will get them next, which will no doubt be to the detriment of the high standards the crews maintain to this day.",24th February 2017,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,5,Heathrow to Las Vegas,Family Leisure,Yes,Positive

(we were in row 13). without notice, we had to go through de-icing which meant a 45min delay to our service (we did however catch up 35mins). our inbound flight was on a newer a319 which had better seats and a skymap. due to slot restrictions at rome and london, this flight was also delayed. during both flights the new buy on board was poorly done, taking forever with a limited range of overpriced products. i therefore can only conclude that the airline that once one just 10 months ago offering meals on short haul flights as well as always being on time is now nothing more than a low cost carrier with older planes and a useless service. what a shame.",15th February 2017,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,3,BLR to LHR,Business,Yes,Positive

"how the mighty have fallen, or should i say continue to fall. my partner and i booked tickets from london to johannesburg back in september 16, we paid approx £1700 for the 2 economy tickets (slightly more than normal as we paid for extra leg room seats). it was an evening flight and we were traveling on the relatively new a380, our first problem was that our there was not enough room for our hand luggage near to our seats, so it was placed some 30 feet further down the aircraft - not life threatening, just annoying when you want to get things out of the bag, we were surprised about the lack of space. our real issue was that when it came to serving our evening meal that the flight attendant announced ""here is your vegetable lasagne"" rather than explaining that for our £1700 they were not able to offer us the default evening meal (chicken or beef) as they had ran out of these! they made no effort to remedy the situation, whether there were other choices in premium or business we will never know, all i can say is that i am pretty easy to please when it comes to food but wasn't happy with a vegetable lasagne so i had no meal as a result. as i left the aircraft i received a text from ba asking for feedback on the flight, i took the time to respond  explaining all the above but received no response. whilst i was in johannesburg i tried to contact/ call johannesburg to complain but trying to contact and speak to anyone at ba is like trying to get an audience with pope francis! i eventually received an email response stating that my complaint didn't qualify for any redress, i then challenged this, i explained that in a hypothetical situation whereas the passenger paid for their fare as they left the aircraft 1) would i have been prepared to pay the full cost of the flight (no!) and 2) would ba if they were reasonable, expect me to pay the full cost. in summary, i eventually was offered £15 credit off my next ba flight - totally unacceptable as i don't fly that often, even £15 shopping vouchers and an apology would have been sufficient, i felt hugely disappointed with our national carrier and it's onboard service and the same for it's customer relations which arrogantly doesn't give a damn. looking back, the point that made me most angry was their total disinterest in me.",29th January 2017,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,3,London to Luanda,Couple Leisure,Yes,Negative

houston to london heathrow in business class. the service from the cabin crew was less attentive and organised than the outbound flight. british airways used a boeing 777 plane rather than the 747 used on the outward journey. this meant there was no upper deck seating. the seats are comfortable and convert to flat beds. both journeys provided a welcome drink and 3 course menu. i found i was still hungry after the meal so made use of the snacks available at the bar. i used the arrivals lounge at lhr which was great to have a shower and some breakfast.,15th January 2017,United Kingdom,Business Class,yes,3,London to Luanda,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

"this latest british airways trip from london heathrow to dallas fort worth just confirms how standards are slipping. background: family living in usa = regular leisure transatlantic flyer, in the last 10 years consistently booking for 2-3 travellers on each trip, regularly flying business for eastbound transatlantic leg. to date transatlantic travel (over 30 years) has been exclusively with british airways. service has been almost consistently good or very good. we may not be gold or silver members, but we don't deserve the shoddy treatment this most recent booking received. 1) original booking for outbound lhr-dfw leg was booked by ba agent over the phone in the wrong category/class, even though it was made clear we wished to purchase an upgrade (cash or airmiles) at a later date. subsequent phone calls over the next few months were a farce, with consistently inconsistent responses - when we eventually managed to get through. the executive club customer service link just sends you round in circles! a formal emailed complaint through ""contact us"" resulted in ""we're sorry to hear you've had problems"" - but no solution offered. teeth gritted and traveled. 2) 9.5 hour flight lhr-dfw departing 1030. refreshments/drinks served 1130ish before lunch. 9year old daughter hungry, no nibbles. when asked, steward responded ""well, that's cutbacks for you"". pre-ordered child's meal arrived 1230, before standard adult meals. no problem. juice and water were available during the afternoon. no snacks available for children for 5 hours! ""cutbacks"". luckily i had a packet of shortbread (as a gift for friends in usa). at 1830 cabin service (tea) started. when i asked for daughter's pre-ordered child's meal, conversation with stewardess went thus - ""why didn't you order one?"" ""i did!"" ""she didn't have a child's meal at lunch"" ""yes, she did!"" ""oh well, i'll check when i've finished serving the main cabin"" really? we were only in the 3rd or 4th row - would it have been too much effort to check then? clearly yes it would. and when she did check some 20 minutes later, there was no child's meal - so they cobbled together a few bits from an unused child's lunch, very ungraciously. no hint of an apology. customer service? customer satisfaction? result: continued loyalty for transatlantic flights? what do you think?",14th January 2017,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,3,BKK to LHR,Business,Yes,Positive
"london to hong kong return. through no fault of our own, very late-running bus, major road accident, and a driver who threw us off in the cargo area and told us to wait for the next bus – my friend and i missed our 18.30 flight to hong kong on december 12th. we thought we would be re-booked on the later 20.50 flight, especially since we had business class tickets. instead, we were told by the ba official at the misnamed ‘customer services’ desk that we had ‘voluntarily’ missed our plane (i assume that was code for ‘it’s your fault, not our problem’; that was certainly what his attitude conveyed). we were then offered 3 options – pay a supplement of £1478 to take the 20.50 flight, take a downgrade to premium economy without a guarantee that ba would reimburse us the difference in seat price, or wait four days. the ba official couldn’t have been less flexible or sympathetic, and ba has responded to my complaint via twitter with the same disinterest. my travel companion’s business class seat was a gift for her 60th birthday. any pleasure she might have got from it, and mine in giving it to her, were ruined by the way we were treated. on the (half-empty) flight back on new year’s eve the crew obviously didn’t want to be there, was barely courteous, and when my friend, a diabetic, enquired what would be in her special meal, she was told no-one knew. they clearly didn’t care, either. they did very grudgingly eventually agree that she could order from the regular menu after making it clear that this was an exception and a ‘privilege’ she was being granted. i would have thought, and expected, a little more courtesy and grace, especially in business class. god knows how the poor souls in the back were treated. i have given my preference to ba for years in order to support my home airline. sadly, i don’t think they deserve my custom any longer, so the next time we fly to asia we will take one of the gulf airlines who at least give the impression that they want and value your custom. ba’s only concern these days is profit at any price; their customer service is as poor as any i’ve ever come across, and their corporate motto ‘to fly to serve’ an embarrassing joke. i’ve flown with them several times a year for the last 35 years, but i won’t be doing it again unless it can’t possibly be avoided. the saddest thing of all is that i don’t think british airways will give a damn.",13th January 2017,Switzerland,Business Class,no,3,London to Tampa,Couple Leisure,Yes,Neutral

(i currently have 588,500 avois on ba that is nearly impossible to use). i requested an upgrade on an upcoming flight from heathrow to atlanta from a premium economy seat to a business class seat. the ba representative said that she could not do this as customers pay for the business class experience - the food, individual flight attendant service and comfort. sleeping is the entire point of purchasing a business class seat - not the food. my comfort was not met. the flight attendants on ba have always been very professional irregardless of the cabin, the point was to sleep.",5th January 2017,United Kingdom,Business Class,no,3,London to Tampa,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

'sorry sir, the plane is now closed'. 'so you sold my ticket on'. 'no sir, but the plane is closed'. 'it cant be closed, there is plenty of time'. 'yes, but there are no seats'. i debated the point. 'i wouldn't debate the point sir, a lot of people have been pushed off flights today, and hotels in london are being booked out, if i were you i would jump on the internet and find accommodation'. because of course it was now my problem to find a hotel room in london (ba cover rooms up to £200, fine, though if you have kids they give you a mere £12.50 to cover breakfast, lunch and dinner for each child - in london, good luck). get a hotel, arrive back at the airport the next day, wait in line for 2 hours (luckily i arrived 3 hours early for domestic flight), get to the check in desk. guess what, i am booked on the flight but it appears my seat has been given away. again, of course, its my problem. 'go to the special management desk sir'. at that desk they tell me it could be today i get home, it could be tomorrow, but its hard to say, given the xmas period. but all in super surly tone, and it was clear this was all my fault. 'you can try another airline sir but they are all booked out' (at this stage i began checking car rentals and ferry times). absolutely disgusting attitude. every other airline i have dealt with, in these type of situations, booked me a hotel, and had a bus waiting or a taxi, with a return boarding pass for the next day. its a shame, as the cabin crew and pilots seem top notch. a team that is utterly let down by corporate, with their weak organisation and poor customer care policies. so i would love to fly ba for the crew and pilots, but given their utterly terrible customer care, its just not worth it.",19th December 2016,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,3,BLR to LHR,Business,Yes,Negative

"singapore to sydney in business class. the price was lowish so we booked—never again. seat comfort was almost non-existent with appalling ergonomics. the in-flight service hit a new low for me: absolutely shambolic, no team effort, aloof hostesses were openly dismissive of passengers. food and drink were cut-price and worsened by late wine and bread. no water offered and meal items forgotten. entertainment choices were sub-par. no noise-cancelling headphones. no cosmetics in the dirty toilets. a dollar-shop amenity bag. i have had better economy experiences than this sector. shame on you british airways.",4th December 2016,Australia,Business Class,no,3,Rome to Heathrow,Solo Leisure,Yes,Negative

"london heathrow to san francisco with british airways. ba was once a classy airline for their first class service, amenities and food. but they have succumbed to the economic pressures to the point their first class service is a lot less than it use to but the price is still absurd even using points. they even hijack you for an additional $1000. or as i like to say, you cough up 200k in points and the $1000 fee covers their real expense for you to sit in first. they have jammed more seats in so the attendants have more customers. the seat in spite of its new design is tighter and less comfortable for a 6'1"", 240 person to do anything but sit up and watch a movie or hope they do not run out of the food selection on the menu. second, the staff use to be the most experienced flight attendants but the last two times i flew ba in first i had young attendants who clearly were not use to serving fc customers. a request for say an additional pillow or second cup of coffee went unanswered more than once which is a sign of inexperience. the last trip flying home in april i was handed a menu with a tasting menu or a traditional menu. first class was maybe 50% full. when it was my turn, i asked the flight attendant if i could select some of the tasting menu along with features from the traditional menu - she said she would check and shortly returned to say they were out of the tasting menu items. now please explain to me how any international first class service could be out of food 10 minutes after leaving the airport? clearly if they do not have enough for mix or matching then this is a stingy sign of cutbacks on the lowest scale to save a few pennies. at the average price of $10,000 for a first class seat, ba should make damn sure first class has all the food you need. their menu also talks about late night snacks and on the last two ba first class flights to the us when i wanted to try these snacks they were gone as they are shared with business class. the food served is both uninspiring and generally on the level of us airlines first class which is cooked to death and reheated. way to go ba, you have sunk to the lowest common denominator. third, when i arrive in sf and in spite of my luggage having a priority tag, it never comes out in the first batch and often towards the end of the delivery so they have failed on even that count. unlike the first class asian carriers like singapore and cathay where my fc luggage arrives first, ba is always hit and mostly miss. finally, what galls me is the worthless survey they ask me to fill out describing my fc experience on ba. i let them know everything i said in this review and the last question asked is ""would you like us to call you regarding this review and experience""? yes, i say and not once has someone called. i am waiting for the day when ba announces ""all passengers including first"" should buy food before boarding and headsets are for sale.",27th November 2016,United States,First Class,no,1,LHR to CPT,Couple Leisure,Yes,Neutral
"first leg dus to lhr was club europe. while business class has no different seating to economy this aircraft was really a joke. it was completely outdated and worst of all it seems to be not cleaned before the flight. crumbs on the seat. table was sticky. asking crew members they apologize and are very friendly and tried to help with cleaning. overall crew on this flight was extremly friendly. next leg from lhr to bos very similar experience: business class was upgraded with an outstanding new ife but seats are still old. the housing of my seat was taped with gaffa tape next to the footstool. asking crew about that they told me that the housing fell off and engineering was not able to fix it so they used gaffa tape. in general the 747-400 looks quite a bit dated and might need a further upgrade rather than the ife and some smaller details (e.g. carpet should be replaced - extremely dirty and roved). lounge in lhr very outdated. boarding in lhr was somewhat uncoordinated as a lot of people don't listen to the announcements and try to board and impede boarding of other persons. crew on board once again very friendly and effective. meal choice was ok. but my impression is that quality is going down, e.g. beef was very fibrous and vegetable was somewhat overcooked. club kitchen -> long time an outstanding feature of ba is a joke nowadays. selection seems to go down every time i fly. worst of all: one of my bags did not made it to the aircraft. this itself can happen and is not a problem at all but the handling of this was a real joke. after identifying that my bag seems to be lost i went to the counter (even if finding it is not that easy in boston). i explained my problem and the lady looked in the computer and said that i did not checked another bag -> although i had my tag that i could show to her. i had to discuss with her for several minutes and had to ask for the manager on duty in order to get a baggage claim written. manager on duty was very unfriendly and except for writing the claim he did not provided any additional help. no apologies for inconvience at all. last year i had one bag that was delayed. this handling was done by another person and was completely different experience. extremely helpful and really sorry about the inconvience. summarizing: flying ba for business for many years and on a regular basis now. the changes under the new boss can be seen. while in the past british airways was really good it seems to decline from month to month. this time flight was one of the worst i ever had with ba. i assume that if there is no change in the near term i will choose another airline in future e.g. a low cost carrier as there is not that much difference any more. if you read a lot of the other reviews you will see that i am not the only one thinking like this. i can't any longer recommend ba as especially the value for money is no longer given.",25th November 2016,Germany,Business Class,no,7,Heathrow to Las Vegas,Family Leisure,Yes,Positive

"london gatwick to mauritius return. our outbound flight had certainly not been memorable, but new to british airways we were prepared to wait and see. the inbound flight commented upon here was much worse, but with many facets of the earlier experience.  we paid two supplements for the flights. a substantial fee to upgrade from economy and a very unpopular one to ensure as elderly clients - on overnight flights - we could sit together! the combined cost therefore was significant. the benefits were not. firstly, upon being seated we were faced with a cabin crew apparently in a bad mood. a lady ahead of us had a headrest problem, she was rudely dealt with and seemed intimidated.  throughout the flight during waking hours, passengers seemed to be a nuisance. food - as we had flown this class on other scheduled airlines, we were expecting a menu to select meals. how silly. here the economy trolley brought appalling food with a twin choice - chicken or veg (a bright green risotto). so, no choice! no bread roll, no cheese and bikkies, a 'choice' of one red wine, and plastic cutlery. this was served after the attention in economy, and may account for the absence of choice. whatever, it was awful. it was noticeable how many meals remained uneaten. what a waste of resources. significantly better quality has been had on holiday airline journeys of shorter duration. the premium economy (wtplus) cabin had no provision for toilets. it was necessary to go forward to club, or back to economy! it became clear early-on that going forward was not popular with those in that cabin, so back it was! during the night, with passenger debris in aisles, this was hazardous with shiny plastic bags (from headphone containers) to slip on. is nobody in british airways capable of seeing the provision of a loo for 24 passengers is essential?  on arrival in uk we read that ba is to put even more seats in economy class on this type of aircraft. goodbye british airways - not even nice to have used you.",8th November 2016,United Kingdom,Premium Economy,no,3,Denver to Heathrow,Family Leisure,Yes,Negative

"after many years of flying on ba, being a gold member for the last 6 years, i have finally lost my patience with ba.  there is no point ba even having a customer relations team as it seems there hands are now firmly tied to be able to do anything for a loyal customer when things go wrong. i recently spent over £4000 on a flight to singapore, outbound being first and inbound in club world. the plane was a fairly new a380 and on the outbound journey, the plane developed issues in the toilets where the toilets were not be drained properly. the crew on board did their best looking after things but still wasn’t a very pleasant experience from the passengers (and the crew might i add!).  on the inbound a few days later, we were delayed by 3 hours because of a pump issue in the toilets where there was no running water throughout the entire plane (must have been the same aircraft as the outbound). the ground crew did everything to try and fix it because they didn’t feel it was fair departing on a 13 hour voyage with no running water in the toilets. it meant no running water to flush the toilet (although the suction system still worked), and not running taps to clean ourselves, and of course no tea of coffee facilities. 3 hours had passed and the crew decided to depart anyway, the answer was to load the plane with loads of bottled water and wipes in the toilets but no tea or coffees throughout the whole journey (they had to get the plane to land back at lhr just before the 3 hour delay to stop each passengers claiming 300 eur under the eu compensation policy (the plane landed back to lhr 2hr 54 min late!). to top things off, after landing back to lhr, the ground crew from ba forgot to tell the airport ground crew of a late gate change which resulted in the bags delivery being delayed by a further 1hr 30 min. so in summary, i get home 5 hours later than planned with toilet issues on the outbound, which created a bit of a smell around the whole aircraft, and toilet issues on the way back delaying the plane and making an uncomfortable journey on the way back and seriously delaying my arrival back home with the baggage issues added to it. everyone has the right to get a decent amount of compensation in this situation regardless of the class they are travelling in - the answer from ba customer relations was 15,000 avios points! what’s 15,000 going to get me? surely i ask you can do more and the lovely lady on the phone (who seems embarrassed herself having to tell me) couldn’t do anymore as the supervisor’s decision is final. can i speak to the supervisor i ask? (i am thinking as a loyal member spending so much on ba he/she might have the decency to speak to me), the answer was no, they don’t speak to anyone.",20th October 2016,United Kingdom,First Class,no,3,Heathrow to Las Vegas,Family Leisure,Yes,Neutral

"washington dulles to nairobi via london. was excited to fly first class on ba from dulles to nairobi, since it's about 15 hours of flying time i decided to splurge on a 1st class ticket. things started off poorly at checkin when ba's computer system went down  a seemingly constant problem ) . after 45 minutes of waiting, they were finally able to get a back up system going and i was checked in and off to their lounge. great meal and service there. my flying companion didn't want to splurge on a 1st class ticket so she was in business class. it wasn't long after we boarded that she came forward to report that their business class seating was the worst she's seen. ba has this squirrelly layout where passengers sit forwards and backwards on the flight, meaning that you lack privacy and someone may have to step over you when you're asleep. well i sprung for an $850 upgrade for her and all was well. until the captain announced that there was an unmatched bag on board and it had to be removed before we could depart. here's where ba's systems again breaks down and their computer isn't working to locate the bag in the hull. 3.5 hours later they locate the bag and we take off. we land 3 hours late at heathrow and miss our connection to nairobi! no one to assist you; head off to another terminal to customer service, wait 30-40 minutes in line to be told that they can put you on a kenyan air flight business class in 8 hours or you can wait til the next day and fly out on ba. we chose kenya airways and arrived the next morning without one checked bag. on our return flight i had booked a business class ticket and asked if they would upgrade me since i couldn't use my 1st class ticket. no, can't do that and you'll have to apply for a refund. meanwhile they upgraded a couple of passengers gratis! i was told later that that is ""promotional"" and to hell with a paying passenger. the bottom line is, don't fly ba if you are going on to a distant location, they are unreliable and assistance is negligible. if you're just flying on to the continent where there are multiple flights you may make it.",11th October 2016,United States,First Class,no,3,Denver to Heathrow,Family Leisure,Yes,Negative

"i have to be upfront and say the flight from london heathrow to boston exceeded expectations mainly due to the cabin crew. over the years british airways first has gone so far downhill i'm afraid it just can't compete anymore, it needn't be so as the issues as i see them are all resolvable. however, the return leg was like flying with ryanair. there were only 13 people in the cabin. there were no slippers, 2 of the menu items i requested were, in the words of the crew ""invisible"", and what did arrive was verging on inedible due to sauce being lumpy and near to warm. the chocolate lava cake contained no lava and quite how one can burn and cool food at the same time is beyond me. my father waited the entire flight, having asked on 3 seperate occasions, for a headset convertor. we were not asked if we wanted to be woken for breakfast, which i then missed assuming i would be woken. there was a palpable tension between the crew, which was confirmed on leaving the flight when we overheard a member of the crew comment he was happier to get away from the crew than the passengers. once we had disembarked the aircraft, it was a further 25 minutes before we could get in to the airport as a door had not been unlocked. finally, we collect our suitcases, which i have to say were present when we arrived at baggage reclaim, only to find 2 of the 4 had broken wheels. ba have subsequently supplied 2 new replacement suitcases. when comparing the service / food to virgin uc for usa and etihad first for east bound, ba just doesn't cut the mustard any longer i'm afraid. such as shame as the seats / bed are great, but why pay the extra £ for service and food that just isn't forthcoming or varies from flight to flight?",26th August 2016,United Kingdom,First Class,no,7,BKK to LHR,Business,Yes,Neutral
"berlin txl to london heathrow with british airways. after purchasing ticket i could not preselect seat assignment despite having one world sapphire status. i called ba 3 times. the first 2 times the agents stated they would select my seat for me and later the assignments dropped out of the system. after the third call the agent emailed me and explained that due to my fare category and despite my status no preselection could be made. at check-in i spent more than 45 minutes online trying to pay the junk-fee for a single piece of luggage. again i had to call ba 3 times to get a bag checked onto my flight. 2 of the calls were to undo the mistake that the first agent made by applying the junk-fee for luggage to my return flight instead of the outbound. the second call was to get a refund and rebook the junk-fee. the third call was to complain about spending 2-hours checking in and correcting ba's mistakes. i spoke with a supervisor and offered to comp my luggage but no one ever bothered to credit the junk fee. the ba lounge at txl is small and does not have a toilet. there were no warm food items on offer. i did find the service to be good. boarding commenced at the farthest point at berlin tegel from the ba lounge. flight was okay with minimal amenities. ba not only does not compete on price but amazingly, no longer competes on service.",24th August 2016,Germany,Economy Class,no,3,London to Tampa,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

"the british airways experience has really declined over the past 5 years. i often fly business class and at least premium economy. the boeing 787 is awesome. clean, spacious and excellent technology/media options. however the staff and service has declined. rarely do the staff seem interested in their jobs - they are on automatic pilot. we travel with 3 children and the stroller has become a real problem. firstly they gave a 5 kg maximum on weight. try getting a 5 kg stroller that works in canadian weather! so we bought a new light stroller - however we have noticed extreme wait times to have the stroller brought to the gate after a flight ends. try travelling with a 2-3 year old through the chaos of terminal 5 in the summer months without a stroller. with a tight 1 hour lay over we waited over 25 minutes for our stroller- the only reason we got it (ground staff forgot) was because the older and very caring pilot went down the stairs himself to get it! the younger staff could care less and left us and 2 other families alone waiting. they could learn a lot from the pilot. also every single flight on our journey ended up leaving 1-4 hours late (a mixed blessing we made our layover because of it!). the good in the lounge and on board has suffered as well. anyway, they have to improve. i fly with 5 family members every year to italy - this time we are using klm or lufthansa - and another bonus us we can avoid heathrow terminal 5.",23rd August 2016,Canada,Premium Economy,no,3,BLR to LHR,Business,Yes,Positive

"i was booked to travel british airways from heathrow to dublin airport in ireland. i arrived at the airport within the permitted check-in times and was held up by a longer than anticipated queue. i went to a check-in bag drop counter where the staff ignored me for a good few minutes as she conducted a personal conversation with one of her colleagues. i was asked to place my bag onto the conveyor belt and issued a boarding pass and baggage receipt. the woman behind the counter then took the boarding pass back and after a few moments i asked her if there was a problem. she nodded and said her computer system would not let me board as my bag had been offloaded even though the bag was still on the conveyor belt and she had issued me with a boarding pass. after 15 mins she told me to take my bag and go to a different area for help. it was bizarre. i joined a second queue where a very helpful man explained that the first person i dealt with had not checked me correctly due to timings. he made a telephone call and as my flight was delayed by almost one hour he told me not to worry and to make my way to through security to the gate. boarding was not efficient. one would expect better from ba. the queue was poorly managed. the cabin crew with one exception were frosty and functional. one cabin crew member, an older lady was superb and i saw her help a young mum with a baby and answering questions from 2 japanese people with limited english. this member of the cabin crew was a superb representative of her airline. my seat was not clean and there were crumbs on the floor. the captain made very clear announcements and there was a nice drop-down screen to show the route of the flight. a cup of tea and a small packet of crisps were offered.  my bag did not arrive into dublin with me and so i had to join a queue for swissport. this is where my nightmare started. a uniformed woman who said she represented ba told me my bag would “most likely” not arrive until tomorrow. i asked her if the bag would be on the next flight and she said no and suggested that i leave the airport and that a courier would deliver the bag to where i was staying. i took her advice only to receive an automated email that same evening to inform me that my bag had indeed been placed on the next flight. over the next few days a nightmare began. i spent many hours calling swissport and their courier dpd. to be fair the dpd staff were helpful and told me the reference number from swissport was wrong. swissport insisted the reference number was correct.",16th August 2016,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,5,LHR to CPT,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive
"london heathrow - vancouver - london heathrow. first impressions could have been better as this flight departs from terminal 3, rather than terminal 5 at heathrow. the departure lounge was being used by multiple longhaul flights on large aircraft meaning that the area as crammed full with most passengers having to stand and making it difficult to access the departure gates. however the ground staff did their best to manage the situation and were clearly used to having to manage it. once on board i found the cabin to be very clean. unlike many airlines, ba offers economy seating upstairs on the a380 where the ride is noticably smoother and quieter than on most other aircraft. however the profile of the cabin means that the overhead lockers are smaller than usual, which could be an issue for those with roller cases. the ife system provided is excellent. i also ordered one of ba's new gourmet meal offerings rather than take the standard meal. this option was well worth taking up, offering an improved choice and quality. the service provided by the flight attendants was friendly and professional and this is one area where british airways seems to do consistently well. if i have a criticism it is that the 31 inch seat pitch seems miserly for a 9-10 hour flight. arrival at vancouver was on time and i was through immigration and landside in about 20 minutes. processing through security for departure from yvr was equally efficient. the return flight offered a similar experience to the outward one, although arrival in london was an hour late. however the relatively quiet cabin on the a380 meant that i was able to get some sleep. unfortunately the arrival experience at lhr terminal 3 was no better than the departure one. a lengthy walk to arrivals concluded with having to join a slow-moving, snaking line to clear immigration. a marked contrast to the experience at yvr.",14th August 2016,United Kingdom,Economy Class,yes,3,BLR to LHR,Business,Yes,Positive

"i fly this route 3-4 times a year, unfortunately there is no competition other than air canada. i've had occasional problems - rude staff, freezing planes, poor service - but generally been satisfied. on this last flight a week ago, the plane has been internally reconfigured, and they have placed large metal boxes in the foot area of every third seat that take up approximately 1/3 of the space, and fully restrict the movement of your feet and therefore your legs for the entire journey if you are a normal-sized adult. i have attached a photo of my feet trapped in this space - i offered to send ba this photo but apparently they are not interested as they ignored the offer along with the content of my complaint, see below. the discomfort caused by the reduced foot space was compounded by a delay of 1.5 hours - for which i did not blame the airline - meaning i spent 8 hours in that position rather than 6.5 hours. then on arrival we in steerage learned that the pre-landing snack had been replaced by a funsize chocolate bar, approximately 2 inches in size. as a result i arrived starving and had to go and eat somewhere after 10pm, and would have brought food on the flight had i known of the miserly cost-cutting measure in advance. i wrote to complain about these aspects of the flight, but primarily the lack of foot space because of the new configuration, as this can't easily be remedied and will put me off using the airline again. i ended my complaint saying i had the distinct impression that there is no respect for economy travellers. i've just received a response which is clearly a cut-and-pasted reply about the 1.5 hour delay and completely ignoring the content of my complaint, indicating that it was not even read, and confiming my impression that they have contempt for the experience of people in economy. which is particularly shortsighted, as some of us will soon be travelling in higher classes due to changes in our circumstances, and we won't forget how we were treated.",14th August 2016,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,5,Rome to Heathrow,Solo Leisure,Yes,Negative

"sadly british airways business class, london heathrow to geneva is no longer worth any extra cost. i'm only 185cm and can't sit comfortably and relax without being sideways. in addition to chamonix we have homes in london and telluride, colorado and ba lost us as customers for quite a few years on the lhr to den, 777 service, again because of the ridiculous seat forward/backward seat configuration in business class, that requires us or someone else to climb over us to get out of the seat during the flight. therefore we flew air nz (much, much better flight if a little inconvenient) to lax (6-8 return flights a year) and suffered longer on united to get to our destination as ba business was so bad. fortunately they now have a 747 on the lhr to den service where we can fly first class which we are using, but it would only take another airline to do this route for us to move away from the ageing cabin staff and extremely average service.",13th July 2016,United Kingdom,Business Class,no,3,London to Luanda,Couple Leisure,Yes,Negative

cannot believe how bad british airways was. we arrived very early at the airport in kuala lumpur to catch a flight to london in premium economy. they would not allow us to check in online and we soon discovered why. the flight was massively overbooked. there are 39 seats in premium economy and they had overbooked by 10. there was a long queue of passengers in economy also who could not get seats. this is utterly irresponsible. very few people book a long haul flight across the world and fail to show up without cancelling. we were told by the manager that this happens almost every night. not a single employee of british airways was there to manage the situation. it was left to the poor malaysia airlines handling staff as agents to try to deal with it. they have offered us an economy seat on another airline with miserable compensation for a journey which would take 7 hours longer. they refused reasonable requests to give us an upgrade on the way home or to offer any other form of compensation. it is all very well for airlines to want to maximise profits but a good airline must care just a little for its passengers. british airways has lost my business forever.,2nd July 2016,Australia,Premium Economy,no,3,Denver to Heathrow,Family Leisure,Yes,Neutral

"flying in club europe from london city to berlin tegel, returning in economy with british airways. the outbound flight was delayed for nearly 1 hour. however, the journey itself was very smooth and enjoyable. the food offered in the ce cabin was delicious. flying back in economy was an absolute nightmare. everything went wrong from checking in, lounge access, baggage claim and extremely poor service relating to my missing luggage. i had done my online check in on my return flight. just went to the check in counter to drop off my luggage. the check in agent offered me a paper boarding pass which later i discovered had been incorrectly issued to me. she checked me in under someone else who happens to have the same last name as mine. after i dropped off my luggage, i went to the business lounge as i am a silver member. i provided the recepitionist my paper boarding pass and entrance was declined. not surprising given the fact that they gave me the wrong boarding pass. however, i showed the receptionist my silver status on my mobile app. she didn't even look at it and told me my membership had been downgraded on her system. she didn't investigate anything and asked me to call up ba which i didn't bother. when i was queuing up at the passport control, i noticed the destination shown on my boarding pass was incorrect. i approached the ba staff at the gate immediately after i had cleared through security. ba staff were shocked that i was checked in under someone else's name. wrong name, wrong flight etc. they asked me to go to the correct gate immediately, but then they also told me my checked luggage was on the wrong flight and i might not have it back upon arrival at lcy. they gave me a new luggage tag. after arriving at lcy, waited for 20mins, bag didn't show up. i approached the baggage claim agent who was on her phone. i explained the situation which she didn't really pay attention and asked me to stand next to the conveyor belt, insisting my luggage would arrive. again, no investigation, rushed service and a bit rude. 3 days later - no luggage still despite the fact that they have located my luggage.",30th June 2016,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,3,London to Sydney,Couple Leisure,Yes,Negative

"los angeles to rome via london with british airways. our flight from lax to rome was on time and generally good. we upgraded from economy to premium economy at the airport for $382 each. we had tried to upgrade ahead of time with our frequent flyer points but could not because we booked through costco (costco said we needed to go thru ba and ba said we had to go thru costco). boarding was not well organized. our flight from london was delayed and we had a difficult time finding out where to go as the airport departures board did not list a gate and departure time kept changing. one ba associate told us it would probably leave from gate 18 which proved to be incorrect information. we finally asked an attendant at a random gate who looked it up on her ipad. we had to sprint back to gate 1 with 15 minutes until departure. when we arrived at that gate, we were told we would be bussed to our gate. we waited another 25 minutes for buses. seats were fairly comfortable. food was just okay - the small steak served was over cooked and as hard as rock. we arrived in rome almost 2 hours late. coming home we traveled economy as we decided the charge to upgrade on the way there was not a good value. our flight from rome to london was late in arriving which made us almost an hour late taking off from rome. boarding was chaotic and you couldn't understand the announcements being made about who was to board and when. other people were turned back rather rudely by ba staff. everyone seemed confused. snack on board was small but tasty. we had to be ""express serviced"" through security in london in order to catch our connecting flight. no time to catch a snack or use the toilet. boarding was in-process when we arrived at the gate. then we sat on the tarmac for an hour before we could take off. seats were very narrow and close together to the point that when the person in front of you reclined their seat, the back of the seat was very close to your face. you had to ""go horizontal""in order to get in and out of the seat to use the rest room. arm rests between seats and at the end of the row did not lift up entirely so you had to slide over the arm rests. food was pretty good. on board entertainment was good. service was slow, forcing you to sit for an extended length of time with a tray squeezed in front of you. our luggage is on an extended vacation as it did not make it to our flight in london. we arrived 25 minutes late to lax. i also take exception to the $90 luggage charge ""per leg of the trip"" for our 2nd bag. 1st bag is no charge but $380 (round trip) charge for the 2nd bag is very steep.",21st June 2016,United States,Economy Class,no,3,Denver to Heathrow,Family Leisure,Yes,Positive

"london heathrow to newark return. having just returned from my holiday, flying with british airways in their world traveller plus class, i thought i would post my review. the week before we flew, we paid the £48 per person to select our seats so i had the comfort of knowing we would be sat together. we flew out of t5 at lhr one what i think is one of ba’s new 787 to newark at 10.35am, and plane interior looked new and clean. we took our seats 21 j and k which were right next to the toilets. on our seats we found a small pillow, blanket, headphones and an amenity kit. i had plenty of leg room (ok, i am 5’5) and my partner had the entertainment box impacting his leg room but he seemed to be ok with it (he is 5’10). although our seats were next to the toilets, we didn’t get disturbed movement or smells. once the curtain was pulled between us and world traveller, you wouldn’t have known we were by the bathrooms. we were offered a glass of something fizzy – water and juice were also available. hot towels were handed out. menus were handed out and main course was a choice of beef or chicken, with a pasta salad to start and a strawberry cheesecake for dessert, with cheese and biscuits. the food was ok, it was hot and tasted good. the food service was quick, and prior to the food served, drinks were handed out including a drink for the meal. however, during food service another drink was also offered. so, three small bottles of wine for the flight and i was well on my way to relaxing and starting my holiday. as we didn’t have anyone behind us, we could recline our seats without worrying about disturbing anyone. as there was a wall behind us, we couldn’t recline as far back as others, but it was comfortable enough. luckily for both of us, the people in front of us didn’t really recline theirs too far. the seat was really comfortable, and even with my generous back side, i felt i had plenty of room. although i had loaded up my tablet with films and books, i didn’t use it at all. neither did i use the vast choice of ife – i used to 6.5hour flight time to have some “me” time. my partner found plenty of choice and enough to watch during the flight. after food, the mood lighting was switched on and stayed that way until we were an hour from landing. most people (me included) took the opportunity to have a bit of shut eye. a sandwich and small chocolate bar, tea and coffee was served and after a quick freshen up (in my seat). the pilot announced we would be landing and that the toilets would only be available for another 20 minutes or so. i quickly brushed my teeth to freshen up, but what was annoying was the number of people who decided to have almost a full make over in the toilets, spending 10 or more minutes in there – whilst the queue of people waiting to use the facilities grew longer. however, the toilets were clean. the landing was smooth and we arrived on time – i suppose you would say we were 20 minutes early, but don’t the airlines have that little trick of appearing to land early? on leaving the plane i did have a look at business class, and without offending regular business class users, i did wonder exactly what you get for your money. all the pods looked very tightly packed together.",19th June 2016,United Kingdom,Premium Economy,yes,5,London to Sydney,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

"we travelled on ba 633 from athens on 12th of june, 2016. the flight departed at 7.55 pm but sat on the tarmac for 30 mins due to bad weather at london. nonetheless, we only got in 15 minutes late. what went wrong from the very beginning was the check in process. we had showed up early but was refused check in at club europe. the ground attendant at athens was incredibly rude and abrupt. if they had explained it to us nicely, we would have been fine with it. the result of the two hour before flight check in resulted in chaos and long lines given the fact that it was a 767 – a larger than usual plane. when we finally lined up, it took a good 30 minutes and more to check in at club europe because for half that time, there was only one counter open. eventually, a second counter opened but a young couple jumped the queue by using the excuse that she was pregnant (unheard of policy and she was perfectly healthy given how fast she rushed up) and that was allowed by the ground atttendants despite the long line-up. eventually we got to the plane only to find a ridiculous two tier business class system that stretched into the economy section without any separation of any kind. seating became problematic as those assigned to the windows on each side had smaller spaces, and in fact were no more bigger than the economy class. the middle seats were fine as passengers there had the empty middle seat. british airways were passing off economy seats as business but though the service was different – you couldn’t properly enjoy it. we were placed on the last row of business class (14) and these were three seats stretching into the economy class cabin. it was so confusing that the crew tried to serve economy class food to our end. to be fair, i think other business class passengers had it more unfortunate in their seat assignments. furthermore, when asked for a blanket, i was refused one on the basis there was none until i walked into the upper cabin and found that business class passengers there had blankets. how is this fair? what principle of seat assignment did they use? the last few ba trips to europe have been nightmarish, from boarding processes (this one in athens was chaotic and unsystematic, they had allowed everyone to rush forward thus blocking the pre-boarding process). we were assigned different seats far from each other and not according to our preferences in our exec club, the online check-in keeps breaking down and when we tell ba that, they tell us to call in (laugh out hysterically here). in fact the more frequent you are a flyer (but not high profile), the worse treatment you get. i also get a sense that communication between the crew is poor given that different services were offered (later on, the cabin director told me she could find a blanket for me but we were already 30 mins from landing). i cannot blame the crew, they work with what they get.  if we knew we were going to be treated no better than economy, we would have booked economy.",18th June 2016,United Kingdom,Business Class,no,1,Heathrow to Las Vegas,Family Leisure,Yes,Negative

"at the beginning of the year i booked 4 first class seats london-kansas usa for myself, husband, son and 84 year old mother to attend a wedding. at that time i also booked wheelchair assistance for my mother, she walks with a stick and cannot walk long distances. at check in they had no wheelchair and called for one. after some time when it did not arrive we were told it would be quicker to walk to security which we did with some great effort for mum. at security we were told the check in staff had not validated our tickets correctly so had to walk back again for them to do this and then walk back to security. security itself was a nightmare despite the fact my mother had a doctors letter she had to stand with her hands raised in the body scanner and was then taken by two staff members to a side room as they wanted a more detailed search. when i complained the supervisor told me i would not be boarding the flight if i didn't keep quiet. once this was completed we walked the long journey to the lounge and i requested again a chair to take my mother to the plane. it arrived but i was told i could not accompany her as they would transfer to a buggy and had to pick up other passengers so we went and boarded and said we would meet her there. the flight was being called for final passengers when my tearful mother finally arrived. the staff had taken her to the wrong gate and then told her if she did no want to miss the flight she would have to walk. on talking to the cabin crew they said this was not an uncommon occurrence. i had spent thousands on the flights, i had booked assistance and checked and re checked pre flight that there would be no issues but the staff just didn't care and saw mum as a nuisance. in the usa the service was brilliant and they never once through security asked my mum to get out of the wheelchair or stand in the body scanner and i was allowed to accompany her all the way. to add insult to injury on the flight back half the tv sets didn't work so they even had to do the safety talk manually and my husband never got his inflight dinner as after 2 hours and no sign of it he told them to forget it as he wanted to sleep. my mum refuses to fly ba again and if it wasn't for the fact that we have so many points and numerous flights already booked for myself, husband and children over the coming year we would transfer our business to virgin and other carriers. i have complained to ba but as of yet no response.",16th June 2016,United Kingdom,First Class,no,5,Denver to Heathrow,Family Leisure,Yes,Negative

"i would have been very disappointed indeed if i had paid a full fare for my business class ticket. the food was just appalling. i could hardly get two mouthfuls our of my starter and the main course (beef) was hard, tasteless and very small. compared to business class meals in say cathay pacific or qatar airways, portions on both starter and main were around 50% less. incredibly, british airways serve such mean meals in business class on a transatlantic route, where they make most of their money, i was hungry after the meal so later on decided to 'raid the larder' but they only had sweet, which i generally avoid. the menu states there would be yoghurt and other stuff there they were not available. the fas were embarrassed and got me some cheese. plus were excellent service, good selection of ife and comfortable enough seats (a larger pillow would do), although i hate having to climb over someone to get out of my seat. british airways revamped iberia after they merged but now iberia has a much better business class product.",11th June 2016,United Kingdom,Business Class,yes,5,BKK to LHR,Business,Yes,Positive
"we arrived at gatwick just after 07.30 to catch the 10.00 flight to st lucia. check in was fine and although security was tight, we were airside just after 08.00. before having breakfast we checked the flight information screen which indicated that the departure gate would be available at 09.00. after tea and toast we checked at 09.00 and the board indicated that the departure information would now be available 10.00. obviously this was the first time that alarm bells start ringing as it was plain to see that we were going to be delayed. the on screen information then changed again to say that the departure details would be available at 11.00. at this point i did venture down to the british airways information desk but as there was a queue of around fifteen people, i gave up and sat down again. at 12.00 the screen info finally said that we had a new departure time of 14.00. during all of this time i should add that at no time was any information (other than the screen) made available to passengers regarding the flight or details of refreshments etc. despite numerous announcements from easyjet and other airlines ba was conspicuous by its silence. we were eventually notified of the gate number and for the first time we were told as we entered the departure area the reason for the delay. apparently there had been a problem with the cargo door and they had decided it needed to be replaced. despite the rather cramped departure area, everyone seemed ready to board until we were told that the repairs were not complete and there would be a further delay and if some passengers wanted to stretch their legs they could leave their boarding passes with the ground staff and leave the departure area. eventually we boarded just after 14.30. when everyone was settled in their seats the pilot apologised again and said the repairs still hadn't been completed and a further delay was likely. we eventually departed just after 15.30 after a delay of over five and a half hours. now i know 'stuff' happens but let's not forget that we were departing from one of ba's home airports and why they couldn't have a second plane available quicker than five and a half hours is anybody's guess. various people writing on online forums have previously spoken about the holiday routes from gatwick being dumbed down by ba in favour of the traditional business routes flying out of heathrow. i have no idea whether this is true or not but i would ask one question, if this flight had been a morning flight from heathrow to jfk, would ba have found a solution quicker? once in the air, the flight was fine, nothing special but nothing bad and would have been acceptable without the delay.",6th June 2016,United Kingdom,Premium Economy,no,3,Heathrow to Las Vegas,Family Leisure,Yes,Neutral

"going against the grain somewhat i have to say that i truly prefer flying with british airways over emirates on the london heathrow - dubai route. having tried both airlines several times i am definitely going to side with ba on this one. firstly, ba offer some really competitive prices on this route. if you happen to have a few avios tucked away then this flight can be a real steal. secondly, out of lhr, ba really does have the best terminal. okay, so terminal 3 for emirates isn't the worst terminal in the world but i much prefer terminal 5. spacious, light and with good dining options. as for the aircraft, well it's a choice between choosing the passenger pleaser that is the a380 or the retro classic that is the b747. i'll happily fly in either, although even after the refit the 747 is still showing it's age. as an economy passenger i have found the product on british airways to be perfectly reasonable. the seat pitch is average, seat comfort is average, ife screen size again is average. you get a choice of the latest blockbusters and a few other options. with emirates you have a huge ife, thousands of films to choose from and slightly better seat width and pitch. however, i've also wondered what the appeal is of choosing from thousands of films that i have no interest in watching. i'd rather just take my ipad preloaded with films i actually want to watch. the lack of wifi isn't a huge concern for me. hopefully the gogo 2ku product ba is installing from 2017 will be more robust. now for the catering. as an economy passenger i'm not expecting much but on the last few flights with ba i have been pleasantly surprised. the food has not only been edible but also really quite tasty. where ba falls down is on presentation which is quite frankly awful. it's also the little extras that i notice. a pre-dinner drinks service. coffee and tea offered throughout the cabin. real cheese and crackers to finish off the meal (as opposed to soft cheese - i'm not 5 years old). with ba you also get a more substantial snack prior to landing. it's just a little tuck box but it is far more generous than the emirates economy offering. i've found the crew to be hit and miss, in fairness, i've found that treating crew in the same friendly and warm manner as you expect to be treated normally brings out the best in them. the recent newspaper deal with the murdoch empire is a nice touch. along with the daily hate and 'i' newspapers to choose from you also get the times, the sun and financial times as complimentary options. arrivals for ba at dxb is a bit of a nightmare. terminal 1 immigration is something else and the journey from runway to stand can be epic. however, the new concourse d for departures is really nice. not too blingy. overall, a pleasant flight. i would happily fly with ba again.",30th May 2016,United Kingdom,Economy Class,yes,3,Rome to Heathrow,Solo Leisure,Yes,Positive
"this was a flight from gatwick to bermuda on a 777 with british airways. the aircraft was clean and reasonably comfortable, and the cabin crew were friendly and attentive. i am 6ft tall and normally have problems with the leg room offered in economy (aer lingus, i'm talking about you) but there was ample leg room. indeed on walking through premium economy and club world on exiting the aircraft i didn't notice a big difference in leg room. i haven't flown ba for quite some years and had vague memories of the inflight meals being particularly shoddy. not this time though. my meal was reasonably nice (chicken korma) and my fiancée had no complaints either with her pasta dish. the crew were round regularly with complementary soft drinks as well as snacks and glasses of water or pure orange. the ife had a good selection, though one gripe is the positioning of the controls. there is a small controller built in to the top of the arm rest. this controller controls the ife as well as your reading light and call button. more than once i accidentally pressed the light and the call button with my elbow while shifting position. a small gripe but it was quite annoying. another gripe is the adverts you have to sit through when starting to watch a new selection. i was on continental and virgin a couple of years ago and don't believe i had to sit through adverts before watching a movie or tv programme. overall, aside from the small ife issues, a thoroughly pleasant flight.",27th May 2016,United Kingdom,Economy Class,yes,9,Denver to Heathrow,Family Leisure,Yes,Positive

"my partner and i were flying from london heathrow to bombay in march and were due to catch an onward flight to goa. unfortunately someone fell seriously ill on the flight and our plane was redirected to istanbul to allow for them to be taken to a hospital. the redirection meant that we arrived in bombay 3 hours late and wouldn't make our connecting flight. when we touched down in bombay the flight attendants said that ba ground staff would help us with missed flights, connections etc, and we should speak with them when we disembarked. on this advice we sought out uniformed ba ground staff in the luggage hall and asked for advice on what to do. they advised us to exit the hall and find an airport-based travel agent and purchase new flights to goa. when we voiced our concerns about not being reimbursed they reassured us saying that ba would definitely cover it, and went on to say that we should wait 14 days before making a claim through the website. armed with this advice from ba staff we went ahead and purchased new tickets. big mistake. since returning home we have duly followed instructions and tried to claim for reimbursement. here is the reply we received from ba customer relations: ""we've received a reply from mumbai who've investigated your case. the agent you spoke to can't specifically remember speaking to you personally. he did mention he'd advised customers with separate tickets to make their own arrangements. he also mentioned ba wasn't responsible for any onward travel costs."" this is an outright lie. i can only conclude that the ba staff member we spoke with in bombay was either fobbing us off or was improperly instructed in what to say to customers. either way british airways should be held responsible for the advice their staff give. poor service at the time and poor customer service in the follow up.",20th May 2016,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,9,BKK to LHR,Business,Yes,Negative

"chicago to amsterdam via london club world / club europe. after a very nice first flight from tampa to chicago with my wife and our 15 months old baby, transit in chicago was really smooth. our stroller was delivered at the gate and with a stroller there was a special bus to transfer us to the other terminal. we did not have to pass security a second time, so we arrived very soon in a crowded business lounge. as a gold member i checked the first lounge, but ground staff did not welcome me because it was crowded too. we found a quiet ""dinner part"" of the business lounge, were seated by a very nice ground staff who offered me a glass of champagne to relax. food was decent. boarding the upper deck of this boeing 747-400 was a pleasure with a csd welcoming us by name. flight was excellent: food amazing, enough cold drinks were offered, cabin crew looking after us and our baby. our baby was playing all the time, singing and talking his own words. after this perfect flight, transit in lhr terminal was again relaxing. stroller was again waiting for us at the gate, very nice. after security we went to the first lounge which was really was crowded, but we found a quiet place to sit. time for a shower, breakfast and relax. last flight to amsterdam was in a full cabin, nice and frriendly cabin crew. the only small remark we can find, is that this last flight there was no stroller waiting for us, but it arrived with our luggage.",27th April 2016,Belgium,Business Class,yes,3,London to Luanda,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

"vancouver to barcelona via heathrow with british airways. i would like to start this review by stating that the only reviews i've taken time to write in my life were positive ones, choosing to ignore negativity. this however will sadly be my first negative review and even sadder to say that i'm taking time to write this before we've even completed our round trip with british airways, to be more direct i'm writing this on our final connector flight to barcelona. on february 24th, 2016 i purchased a round trip with cancellation flight from vancouver, canada to barcelona, spain. this was a surprise for fiance for her 30th birthday as well as our 1 year engagement anniversary. naturally we counted down the days in excitement booking ourselves an apartment and scheduling reservations for dinner as well as tickets to a barcelona fc match. even setting up scheduling for grandparents on each side for our 9 month old daughter.  april 16th, 1 day before our trip i receive a email labeled ""updated travel itinerary."" when i opened the email, our flights no longer included our flight from vancouver to barcelona, actually they only had a return flight from barcelona on april 27th. as i had got home late on april 16th from cuba, i couldn't contact anyone until early morning of april 17th (my fiance's birthday). convinced it was just a mistake we thought nothing of it. upon calling in the morning we were informed that our flight had been ""cancelled"". we tried everything we could to make any flight happen that day but were told there was only 1 seat remaining and that my fiance could fly out on the 17th and i follow on the 18th, which as an engaged couple makes no sense. we decided to look past this and try to seek reimbursement for the apartments fees and other things that we were now out of money on due to arriving a day late. this began a huge run around of my fiance trying to submit their online form 3 separate times only for the screen to read ""submitting"" for roughly 30-60 minutes each time, never one actually submitting. we decide again to overlook this and deal with it at the check in counter at yvr. the agent we were speaking to was a very nice lady who went above and beyond to figure out what happened to our flight the previous day as it left as originally scheduled without us on it. she put a note on our file that an agent from jacksonville ba had cancelled our flights for no apparent reason. we asked for an upgrade on our seats, that wasn't available to us. we asked for access to the ba lounge while we waited, we were told that was full even though we walked past an empty lounge on the way to our flight. after a very uncomfortable flight to heathrow we spoke to an agent there, who again was helpful in pulling up our file notes and sending a email to get the ball rolling for us on the reimbursement process (which we still have to wait for a reply before we can go ahead trying to recoup slome of our losses, which unfortunately still wouldn't get us the day we missed back). she went the extra step to grant us access to the lounge while waiting and moved our seats up a few rows. that was a breath of fresh air until we realized that we had been moved to the row right behind the curtains. while we snacked on a 1/4 of a sandwich portion of food we could hear the plated dishes on the other side of the curtains and good food people were eating all the while staring at minimum 4 empty seats. we are now trying to make jokes out of the fact of if we will ever get home.",20th April 2016,Canada,Economy Class,no,5,BKK to LHR,Business,Yes,Neutral
"i am writing to complain about my deeply distressing british airways flight from london heathrow - cape town with a change at johannesburg. the flight was badly managed throughout. when i arrived at heathrow, i was told by a member of staff that my name was not on the system. she eventually found it, she then said 'oh im sorry to tell you that there are no more seats on the flight.' i was obviously distressed by this as imagined i would have to return back to dorset? however, after much insisting she eventually eventually found my seat. i arrived at the gate in good time for my flight to johannesburg. however we were all waiting for about a further half an hour past the time we were meant to have departed the airport. in this time, there were no explanations as to why we were so late boarding the plane. once on the plane, again we waited and waited and waited - and eventually we were told that 'sorry for the inconvenience, but ba did not have enough time to the the engineering works, or refuel or do the mandatory paper work for this plane during the day.' so we were extremely late in setting off from heathrow. i think this is a poor excuse for not departing at the correct time and we were not given enough notifications throughout the lengthy wait. i was concerned about catching my next flight from johannesburg to cape town. the flight attendant told me not to worry and there will be lots of ba ground staff to help us all when we arrive at johannesburg. however, this could not have been further from the truth. once landed there were no british airways staff present - except for one lady in a high vis jacket who explained to people that needed to get the connecting flight to johannesburg to leave their luggage as it would be put on the plane and to run to the next gate for the flight. she then pointed at a man (he was wearing no uniform) saying he will take me and another passenger to gate. we literally ran through the airport and then the man asked for a tip? i gave him £5 but was extremely suprised that i would have to 'tip' someone who supposedly ba advised me to go withonce getting to the gate and (just in time) the lady at comair said radioed through and told us they had already sold our tickets, and rudely shouted at me as to 'why? did you leave your luggage' by this point i had tears falling and was feeling extremely overwhelmed. she then told us to 'just go back' with no further help. luckily another passenger was with me and was kind enough to show me the ba check in desk to ask for new tickets to cape town. once at the ba deskthey were not helpful in the slightest. they simply told me to go and get my luggage from a 'menzies' which was the other side of the airport and see if it was there. i ran too and fro the menzies (lost luggage) to the comair and ba office - back and forth for around 2 hours. no staff were helpful even though i was crying and feeling completely bewildered.",17th April 2016,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,3,LHR to CPT,Couple Leisure,Yes,Negative

"british airways from seattle to johannesburg via london heathrow. first leg sea to lhr was on a 747. the plane was satisfactory to me. i don't understand the comments from people who think the 747 is tired or worn out. not a bad ride in economy when the person in front of you doesn't recline their seat. i sat in one of the ""twosomes"" (seat 52a) in the tail. the food on this leg was bland, the continental breakfast was a disappointment. i would buy seat 52a again if i was traveling on a british airways 747, but be advised there is no wall next to 52a that you can lean on to sleep. second leg was on an a380. i sat in the tail of the upper deck in seat 82a. this time, the young woman in front of me reclined to the maximum as soon as she could and kept her seat that way the entire 11+ hours of the flight. the a380 is a very nice plane and the overall experience was pleasant despite extensive turbulence the majority of the way. the upper cabin on an a380 is amazingly quiet. the food on this leg was far better with an english breakfast served prior to landing in jo-burg. i would not play for seat 82a again because there are two boxes under the seat in front of 82a that limit foot room, but i would play for seat 82b, which is an aisle seat. ife on both legs was pretty sad but i'm not one for popular culture. cabin attendants on both legs were polite and did a very nice job. ba ground personnel at heathrow were very nice and helpful. i've traveled between south africa and north america about a dozen times over the past two years. flights that require you to change planes in the middle east or europe fly over africa and so tend to be very bumpy even at night when most convective activity dies down. nonstop flights that are routed over the atlantic ocean tend to be much smoother.",23rd March 2016,South Africa,Economy Class,yes,9,London to Luanda,Couple Leisure,Yes,Positive

"top ten reasons to not use british airways to all: be aware and be on notice- travel at your own risk i have travelled for years on many different airlines, and i have to say that british airways ranks as one of the top two most horrible airlines to fly. don’t waste your time or money. customer service is non-existent. please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once, they have your money, you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye. we used them to travel to europe and it was the worst experience i have had with an airline in years. when you work hard and save your money to travel, you expect a good experience. welp not with this company. who i am sure, makes millions on customers per year. i understand that sometimes things happen, but this started right after we booked our flight and the bad experience did not end until we set foot back to our hometown. please take note: #1 - the customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website. i had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered. trust me, the number is a secret. #2 – when you finally find a customer service number, there is a long wait and when or if someone answers, they will not resolve your issues. instead, they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to. no one takes ownership #4- what airlines operates 365 days a year and around the clock but doesn’t have customer service reps to help you, the customer? british airways that’s who. #5 - they will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you, at all. no email, no text. #6- if you are not the primary on your ticket you will get no notifications or even if you are the primary, you may or may not get notifications. #7 - if you pay for seats and you pick them, it doesn’t matter, they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid. #8 - the flight may be cheaper, but it is not once you are done paying for seats. #9- they will route to another partner airline and not notify you #10 – if you have a connecting flight, they will cancel one leg and not the other and not notify you. i will never use them again. and if this review helps one person that heeds my advice, then my job is done.",23rd May 2023,United States,Premium Economy,no,9,London to Luanda,Couple Leisure,No,Negative

"paid a quick visit to nice yesterday from heathrow. decided to go business class since my last short haul flight in economy was a real crush and rather unpleasant. i paid over £300 for a business class round trip. i went into the to ba lounge in terminal 5 which was very crowded. being 6.30 in the morning i decided against having a drink and stuck to the breakfast offering. the cooked options did not look that appealing but the fresh fruit selection was very enjoyable. we subsequently discovered a much nicer ba lounge closer to the gate, b36, and waited there for 40 mins. boarding was efficient and we got ourselves seated in 2a and 2c, seat 2b was blocked out, which acted as an additional table. there did not seem to be any difference in the width of the seat from the cramped seating in economy but there may have been an additional inch of leg room. i think that ba are trying to outdo easyjet in terms on no frills. it would not cost ba that much to supply business class passengers with a complimentary newspaper to read during the flight. the inflight magazine is no longer available. there are no screens so there was zero in terms of in flight entertainment. the inflight wifi was flaky at best and non-existent at other times. i was glad it was only a two hour flight. i really do not think the fare that we paid was worth the money",22nd May 2023,United Kingdom,Business Class,no,3,London to Sydney,Couple Leisure,No,Positive

"regarding the aircraft and seat: the business class seats on this flight were pretty good. all were of the suite type, where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacy. the downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple, its quite difficult to interact. there is ample storage and usb charging ports. the seat is pretty comfortable. as someone who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights, this was one of the only times i've been able to get a few minutes sleep here and there. the amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines. the leather toiletry bag was quite nice though. no slippers, only a pair of socks. the restrooms on the flight are very small, and don't provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines. no free wi-fi in business class is not acceptable. another example of ba's penny pinching in recent years. regarding the staff and customer service: poor. inattentive. beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight. i had to go and find an attendant and ask. there was also no offer of any snacks. rude at times. my partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty. the attendant was incredibly rude in response. this left us shocked. different customers seem to receive a different quality of service. a customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were, whether they needed anything etc. whereas my partner and i were not afforded the same level of personal service. this is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service. the food was pretty bad. i had risotto while my partner had chicken. both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge. the vegetables were discoloured and flavourless. the bread was nice though. the breakfast wasn't much better. summary: ba has become the ryanair of long haul. the customer service is way below what i would expect for a premium airline in a premium seat. you pay a premium price for a very average service. if there are other options available i would choose them over ba these days.",28th April 2023,United Kingdom,Business Class,no,3,BLR to LHR,Business,No,Neutral

"very poor flight from cape town to london. after the chaos of cape town airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight. boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne. the captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the 6.00 am lifting of the overnight jet ban at heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so. this was no big deal. then the captain announced that due to it issues at heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period. with the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for business class but this was not forthcoming. in the event take off was permitted quite soon after. the crew had distributed menus but then did a pa to say that there were changes to each of the main courses. a drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks, for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner. drinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off, in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne. dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler. the food looked bland, unappetising and tasted the more so. the cheese (two small pieces) were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney. no top up of the wine was offered (we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis) and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence. the flight was some 11 hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake. breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner. coffee or tea were offered by individual mug, orange juice was available on request. cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items. come on british airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes. for the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort (flatbed) as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below 25% of the price paid for the premium cabin. time was when flying in business class was real treat, no longer is this the case.",2nd April 2022,United Kingdom,Business Class,no,3,London to Tampa,Couple Leisure,No,Positive

"utterly appalling company. we've flown with them two times now, and both times it's been a disaster. the first time: return flight was delayed by over 24 hours. there was nobody at the gate to tell us this, so a large group of passengers had to roam round dubai airport looking for ba staff. there were none. eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs, where a very angry person told us it was our fault, and we should have been given a letter. we had no letter. they then put us on a bus to the other terminal. when we arrived, there was nobody to greet us. we were literally just left there. we had to, yet again, contact another airline, who managed to find us transport to the hotel. when we got there, we were told it was full and we couldn't choose our rooms. we were given a terrible, dirty, cramped room. several times throughout the night we were called to tell us our flight had been moved. eventually we got to board the next day. my tray table was broken, as was the window blind, and i didn't get a meal. no compensation was offered. the second time i need to reschedule my flight. the website assured me this was fine, but provided no link. i needed to phone up. if you need to phone ba, don't even bother trying. i never got to speak to anyone, and just ended up booking a hotel to wait for my flight rather than rescheduling. the food has been terrible, meagre portions given infrequently. my sandwich was inedible.",19th January 2022,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,9,Rome to Heathrow,Solo Leisure,No,Negative
over the past 2 years i have flown with british airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in london heathrow for a 1 hour flight home to newcastle. while the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at heathrow are useless. first time in february 2020 i got stuck in heathrow due to storm ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault. however the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke. they had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100+ unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker. their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop. in the end after a 12 hour battle i was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when i finally spoke to someone. in november 2021 i decided to give ba a second chance and booked to go to new york. since the plane landed late into lhr i missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while. as i rushed through customs i did manage to make it to the gate with 5 minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight. my layover was now 10 hours and all i got from the guest services was a £12 food voucher to spend and a phone number for what i thought was complaints but after being on hold for 20 minutes found out it was not from complaints. considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for £12 seemed really cheap. a few days after i got home i then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed i was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working. when i got a response i said i wanted 20-25% back off my holiday. i got an apology and told the staff at heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation i was offered nothing!,12th January 2022,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,7,Gatwick to Venice,Solo Leisure,No,Negative

"what has happened to british airways? the whole pre-flight experience now is prehistoric, they appear to have gone back to the 80’s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue. on the premise it’s due to covid precautions! they are the only airline making passengers do this and they can’t even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff, like the post office in 1980! apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where they’re just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace. i’ve chosen and insisted upon ba for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles, i also have not one but two ba amex companion vouchers that cost me 40k of spending to earn so that tells you how much i’ve supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years. in the last year i’ve booked 6 ba flights, 1 personal and 5 business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries, 5 of the 6 have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines, the personal one to st lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeks. that cost me my £2500 holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation! a couple of weeks ago i noticed that one of my amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on nov 12th this year so i tried to speak to them. as the world has largely been closed since march 20 i assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open, not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday, but after 2 days going around in circles speaking really bad english to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country i finally got through to someone at ba who told me that no they won’t extend the voucher! i’m even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect i will not spend another penny with this airline, i’m not even going to bother using my second voucher and i’ve cancelled my ba amex. i work in the music business managing tours for bands so i reckon i book 1000 flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that! roll on the inevitable ba administration but at least somebody else can buy it for cheap and start rebuilding what was once the worlds favourite airline but now the most ridiculed. who’d have thought ba could ever make ryanair look like an attractive option.",21st October 2021,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,3,London to Sydney,Couple Leisure,No,Negative

"i booked my flights to the uk in may 2019 and had to cancel our trip to the uk on march 12, 2020 .. 4 days prior to leaving because a travel ban was going to start on march 16, 2020 and because i am older and have pre-existing health conditions, my doctor asked me to postpone our trip. the british airways customer care associates i talked with were great and caring and they were able to issue us travel credit for tickets that were non-refundable. now the problem is, i need to rebook and use the travel credit by may 2020 for travel to the uk by may 2021 or lose all the credit from our trip. how can i make travel arrangements by may 2020 with the coronavirus out of control throughout the world and travel bans in place? i understand ba has policies in place, but i cannot understand how you can expect someone to make travel arrangements while the world is dealing with covid-19. i feel this timeline is unfair to any consumer who has trust with their preferred airline, my preferred airline is still british airways. british airways needs to reevaluate their policies during a world crisis....and make adjustments as needed to be fair to consumers who trust them. whether a consumer has purchased refundable or non-refundable tickets should not matter, because forcing a consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is happening and not adjusting your policies to the situation can change your loyal customers, remember, there are many other airlines out there to choose from. the coronavirus is something that no one has any control of. i guess the bottom line is i think british airways needs to put some common sense to their policy. i want to rebook and travel, but i am hesitant to this at this time. hopefully, may 2020 this pandemic is over for all of us.",23rd March 2020,United States,Economy Class,no,5,BLR to LHR,Business,No,Positive

gatwick to orlando. excellent customer service. on arriving at gatwick airport and checking in i learn that my interpretation of the usa esta rules was wrong and that i would have to apply for a new esta valid for the duration of my trip. this took longer than it should have and ba kept check in open for my party and a member of their check in staff came and found me in the terminal and got our bags checked in and our boarding passes and got us rushed down to our waiting aircraft. the aircraft was clean and despite my best efforts we left on time. during the flight drinks were served and two food services. towards the end of the flight i developed a bad nose bleed the stewardess that attended me was very kind and caring. so despite my best attempts to be a bad passenger ba really came through for me. the return journey went without a hitch and ba's check in at orlando was quick and easy.,15th August 2019,United Kingdom,Economy Class,yes,3,Heathrow to Las Vegas,Family Leisure,No,Neutral

madrid to london heathrow on a busy monday evening in november was an entirely mixed affair. boarding was from the satellite terminal which was efficient and well managed. boarding was rather slow as too many people were allowed to bring aboard large amounts of luggage. this resulted in some bags being removed and placed into the hold. some passengers were poorly behaved and argued with the staff. every single seat was occupied. this was quite hard on the staff. a trendy safety instruction took place with a video of certain uk based tv personalities. this was in english only. the inflight service was very poor. i ordered a sandwich and a drink and had my receipt chucked at me. disembarkation was slow again due to the large amount of luggage. i regard this as a health and safety matter. british airways is not what it was and on this route there are alternatives offering better service.,19th November 2017,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,3,Heathrow to Las Vegas,Family Leisure,No,Positive

(we had three checked bags instead of 2 and british airways only allows one checked bag or you pay close to $100 for additional). luckily the gentlemen at the counter checked the bag at no charge. i can't say the same for the rest of our trip. we found that the flight was full and they had not placed our seats together for a 6.5 hr flight and we had 2 middle seats. the neighbors on our flight refused to swap seats, originally then after some pity complaining a lovely woman swapped. we arrived into london around 9am. late of course, and after running to the next terminal in an attempt to make our connection, we missed our flight and were unable to make it through security. the ba representative told us the next flight was full and we would have to wait until 5pm. we again explained that we were on our honeymoon and had afternoon ticket reservations in rome. the ba representative was then able to find two seats on a 12pm flight - so we missed our ticket reservations but were able to get into rome for dinner. upon our return flights, we attempted three times to reserve seats online via british airways app and web (learning from before) and the website kept giving us an error screen even though the charge was pending on my paypal account. we eventually had to make an international call and pay $174 to ensure we were able to sit next to each other on the 8 hr flight home, though we could not select seats for our connecting flight to london. once we arrived at rome to check - we got hit with the $100 additional baggage fee (we we tried to explain, the representative refused to comp the bag). upon arriving at the gate my ticket was pinged for having an extra bag that was not paid for. luckily, we had the receipt from paying 2 hrs earlier. otherwise i imagine we would've had to shell out $100 again. we are crossing our fingers for a safe trip home, as we are again delayed on our flight from rome to london. if you fly british airways prepare to be nickled and dimed at every part of your journey.",18th November 2017,United States,Economy Class,no,5,Gatwick to Venice,Solo Leisure,No,Positive

"london heathrow to munich return. it used to be an enjoyable experience flying ba. sadly all the cutbacks are kicking in now, and travelling ba just feels like a bit of a chore. the loss of the free bar/food service on european flights is a real step down. even worse is the cynical way in which it happened: downgrading the food offering so much that it seemed like an 'improvement' to offer paid-for m&s food on board. oh, and how replacing my free drink with the same drink, only now i have to pay, is an 'improvement' in service is beyond me. not even a free tea or bottle of water? (i asked for tap water on a flight earlier this year to avoid paying, only to find it tasted of chlorine - wouldn't recommend you do the same). the 'card-only' payment system is chaos as well, it takes forever for the trolley to get from one end of the plane to the other. next on the list is the outrageous prices that ba charge to select a seat in advance. not wishing to pay this, by the time i checked in for this flight (the maximum 24 hours in advance) there were only 5 or 6 seats on the whole plane i could choose from. i took the sole window seat available right at the back of the plane, which is far from my first choice of seat. other carriers let you select seats at check-in for free, and easyjet charge about half of what ba charge to select the equivalent seats in advance (and if you pick one of the 'preferred' seats with easyjet, you also get priority check-in and boarding for your money - not so with ba). check-in at t5 was also a hassle on this occasion as the first check-in machine wouldn't work at all, and the second printed a boarding pass but wouldn't let me print a bag tag. so i couldn't use the bag drop counters after all and had to queue up at the check-in desks, wasting time. there was a minor delay due to fog, but that wasn't ba's fault and didn't have a hige impact. flight itself was pretty smooth and cabin crew were good. on the way back, our business meeting finished early so we tried to take advantage of the one remaining real 'pro' to flying ba in europe with standard economy fares - the ability to switch between flights for free on-the-day. could we? no, the earlier flight was full. rather than sit in munich airport all afternoon, we rebooked on lufthansa instead. in summary, if flying ba on european routes these days, be aware that ba is now a no-frills carrier. lower your expectations to this level, and you'll probably have a pleasant flight.",6th April 2017,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,9,LHR to CPT,Couple Leisure,No,Positive

""lunch"" was a mars bar or similar. i did not bother with the ""buy on board"" stuff on the flight to edinburgh - i get a better choice in the terminal when i get off the aircraft. the domestic flight back from edinburgh to heathrow had the most appallingly childish cabin crew i have ever seen on ba, giggling at each other during the safety demonstration - very unprofessional. the evening meal out of london back to kuwait was more like a snack, with a smallish steak, three snap peas, three baby carrots (i counted the things), and another babyfood potato thing. ""breakfast"" was a muesli bar. sorry guys: a comment on this board that ba equals ""budget airline"" just about sums it all up. i have other choices from the gulf back home, and next time i will be thinking about taking one of them: the only attraction with ba is the extra legroom in premium economy, the choice of entertainment, and the direct flight to heathrow rather than having to fly down the gulf and return. otherwise, the epitaph ""how the mighty have fallen"" springs to mind.",6th March 2017,Kuwait,Premium Economy,no,5,BKK to LHR,Business,No,Positive

"what a disappointing experience flying british airways from london gatwick to mauritius. flew club class and the service was merely adequate, they did what they had to do and no more - at no point we were made to feel valued customers. a request for a cup of tea after dinner, resulted in no tea brought (it was allegedly given to another passenger), when we had fruit as a dessert, it was given with no plate, bread at breakfast was also given without a plate - had to be put directly onto the tray. on the flight out the new film releases advertised in the onboard flight magazine, weren't available to view. given that we paid a lot of money for these tickets, the service given was very poor and the flight attendants not overly friendly. ba now seems to be a budget airline with regard to service and amenities but premium in price. flew emirates last year to mauritius and there is no comparison. emirates wins hands down. ba needs to get its act together as it will loose customers.",1st December 2016,United Kingdom,Business Class,no,3,BKK to LHR,Business,No,Negative
"check-in at singapore airport is carried out in a separate area away from the desks and it was done quickly, efficiently and enables you to bypass the queue to enter the terminal. boarding was chaotic. after announcing families with children, first and club passengers, and cardholders, the staff simply let everybody head towards the entrance. as before, the cabin crew were professional, helpful and enthusiastic. dinner was served quite soon after takeoff because it was a late evening flight. it seems a shame that in its desire to cut costs, british airways uses tablecloths and napkins which seem a little too thin and the cutlery is slightly too small. nevertheless, the food was tasty and cooked properly and there was a good selection of wine and spirits. after a couple of glasses of port they made my bed and i slept soundly for several hours. the seat is equipped with two usb ports but these put out such little power by iphone took a long time to charge and they could not handle an ipad. we landed at heathrow on time and reached terminal 5 within a matter of minutes. one of british airways’ greatest assets is its cabin crew who, in my experience, are considerably better than their rivals. what the airline needs to do is to stop attempting to save money and start giving its premium class passengers those little extras that they have become accustomed to on other airlines. it might have been a one-off but it also needs to ensure that boarding is carried out properly.",29th November 2016,United Kingdom,First Class,yes,9,LHR to CPT,Couple Leisure,No,Positive

(seeing a theme here) and so cheese was fetched from club. afternoon tea sandwiches were dry and bland. in the race to the bottom, ba continue to cut service - especially on the food front. i don't find it acceptable in first class for something as simple as cheese to run out with club food being substituted. this may save money (and wasted food) but the crew whilst cheerfully making the best of a bad job are not being given the food or or product to deliver first class service. in fact, the crew were the only saving grace. ba don't seem to get it. even in premium cabins, they continue to downgrade service to save money and gain an even worse reputation as the uk's flag carrier. biz and first class products are dropping at an alarming rate. wake up ba and iag - before it's too late.",18th November 2016,Canada,First Class,no,5,London to Tampa,Couple Leisure,No,Positive

"my wife and i have been flying british airways short haul in club europe for several years and until recently have been more than satisfied with the service provided. noticeably, this year that service has become far more erratic culminating in an extremely poor performance and unpleasant experience on this recent flight to malta ex gatwick. departure time was 0750 and we arrived at premium check-in at 0620 to find only one member of staff manning the desks serving first and club. there were at least 10 parties waiting in the queue, some of whom defected to economy desks which were heavily manned with faster moving queues. only after more than 15 minutes did extra staff arrive and when we reached the desk the attitude of the check-in lady left much to be desired - robotic, unsmiling and disinterested is probably a kind description. it would have been good to have been informed that the no 1 lounge was available in the absence of the ba offering, but no mention of a lounge was made at all. the no 1 lounge struggles to cope with the additional passenger load, but that is another story. boarding was fine, but the in-flight service from a totally disinterested cabin crew was perfunctory at best. the meal service was late and slow with no drinks of any sort offered until after all meals had been dispensed. clearing the meal was even worse. the flight was in final approach to luqa when, returning from the toilet, i saw one of the cabin crew sitting in the galley playing solitaire on her i-pad whilst bottles and glasses remained at seats which then had to be hurriedly removed as the captain announced ""cabin crew to seats for landing"". should i have apologised for being a mere passenger interrupting this lady's games session? appalling - and such a contrast to several lhr-prg early morning flights over recent years when it has been a joy to fly ba. this may just have been a bad flight, but i fear that this is the future for ba unless somebody at the top reads these reports and takes remedial action before it's good name is lost forever.",17th October 2016,United Kingdom,Business Class,no,3,Denver to Heathrow,Family Leisure,No,Negative
"flew with british airways for the first time from sydney to london return. very unsatisfactory compared to premium economy experiences with other airlines. had to pay to preselect seats and not only was there no priority boarding, the world traveller plus customers in fact were the last to board. there were only 6 rows of premier economy, yet was told that the meal choice has ran out. the meal took me back to air travel in the 1970s. the starter consisted of 6 tasteless pasta spiral and 1 cherry tomato. the fish was dry and tasteless and the rice an unappetising grey colour. the dessert was a square of plain cheesecake. hot beverages at breakfast were served in thin paper cups. there was no other service, no offer of water or snacks between the meals. toiletry consisted of hand wash and nothing else. the toilets were not cleaned and replenished during the stop over in singapore. the seat was comfortable enough but has only a foot rest rather than the leg rest of other airlines. ba world traveller plus is certainly not value for money and i will not travel with them again.",16th October 2016,Australia,Premium Economy,no,1,BKK to LHR,Business,No,Neutral

"singapore to heathrow. british airways gave me something i wasn't expecting - probably my worst long-haul flight experience ever. clearly ba's cost-cutting measures have been primarily concerned with turning economy travel into the genuine 'cattle-class' experience. they really need to up their game to compete with singapore airlines and emirates - who deliver economy class travel at a completely different level. ba - where do i start? cramped seats - even felt extremely small to the children (6 and 8) and little leg room. that feels quite tortuous after 5 hours of travel, let alone 12. the food was laughable - yes, it says on the marketing blurb there are 12+ menus to choose from, but it fails to mention that they are inedible. i thought the children's meals of macaroni cheese would be a safe bet - the grey gelatinous block that turned up made even the cabin crew blush. the entertainment system just about kept the children entertained - but the high hopes of kiddie rucksack, quality 'kids' treat food and a warm welcome for the under 12s was completely lacking.if you have a choice go with another airline. go with emirates.",13th October 2016,Australia,Economy Class,no,5,Gatwick to Venice,Solo Leisure,No,Positive

"we recently flew british airways business class from calgary to rome via london and returned the same route. like previous reviews we too will avoid british airways at all costs. although the cabin service and staff on all of our routes was exceptional the layout of the international business class seating is brutal! who designs seating where you have to either bother your fellow traveler to get out or climb over their feet?  even worse is what british airways sells as business class within europe. they are nothing more than economy seats with the middle one blocked off. my husband is 6'4"" and i'm 5'10"" and our knees were jammed up against the seat in front of us. could you make your passengers feel anymore cramped?! my biggest complaint about british airways is having to pay to reserve my seats! they are the only international carrier that does this. even in business class. when i logged on 24 hours in advance, there were no seats to choose from - and to my utter surprise my husband and i weren't even seated together. shame on you british airways for being so cheap! we are flying to europe again shortly and will definitely be looking elsewhere! on the plus side, food and service on our flights was exceptional but your customer service leaves much to be desired.",10th October 2016,Canada,Business Class,no,7,LHR to CPT,Couple Leisure,No,Negative

"las vegas to london heathrow return, and we did not have a good experience with british airways. both flights were incredibly hot and stuffy, unlike anything i've ever experienced flying on any other airline. i tend to run cold and usually need a sweater on planes, but i was uncomfortably hot the whole time. my husband and some of the other passengers sitting near me also commented on how stuffy it was. the staff on our return flight were rude to passengers and nice only to a select few. i definitely got the impression that you are either a have or a have not with this airline, and if you're a have not then don't even bother expecting any courtesies from the staff. the people sitting next to me had a complaint and it took 3 hours for a staff member to address them. on our return flight, we asked about paying to upgrade our seats but were told it was a full flight and we wouldn't be able to because some passengers were receiving complimentary upgrades and others were being downgraded. i thought it was odd that they would be giving free upgrades if it meant downgrading passengers who had paid for better seats, but what was even more odd was that some passengers didn't know they'd been downgraded until they got on the plane! a group of passengers got on the plane and went to their seats only to find that they weren't the economy plus seats they'd paid for and reserved - they were regular coach seats. they had all the paperwork showing that they'd paid for economy plus, so this wasn't an error on their part. they were told it was a full flight and they could get off the plane if they wanted. a couple of passengers in this group were elderly and had paid for economy plus because an elderly lady in the group had a medical condition with her blood circulation so she needed the extra leg room. this poor old lady had to spend at least half the 10 hour flight standing in the aisle. the boarding process in las vegas was smooth, but boarding at heathrow was a joke. the staff only made one announcement, and must not have had their speaker turned on because it was barely audible. as a result, no one knew where they were supposed to go and people were standing in the wrong lines and basically all over the place. it made boarding take forever. the entertainment selection was sub par for such a long flight. a few decent movies but not much else. i thought the food was decent and they served plenty of food and drinks for the flight.",15th June 2016,United States,Economy Class,no,5,LHR to CPT,Couple Leisure,No,Positive

"i was very impressed with the world traveller plus experience on british airways from london heathrow to san francisco. obviously this is a very new aircraft for ba, but the seat and service experience really were very good and so much more pleasant than an economy flight. i had a window seat, so benefited from the extra space afforded by the location of the storage cabinets underneath the windows. the seat was very comfortable situated on the upper deck in the a380 which is a very quiet plane to travel in, and i enjoyed a couple of movies on the large screen with great sound via the supplied noise cancelling headset. the food was pretty good, and alcohol freely served. the only negative experience was being turned back from priority boarding at lhr even though i have ruby status with ba. the ground agent was a little condescending in the way he handled it to be honest and of course i felt embarrassed in front of the other passengers, but the signage by the priority boarding lane clearly indicated that ruby travelers had the benefit of priority boarding. i was a 10 year qualifying gold card holder on british midland, but ba has chosen to not recognise all the frequent travelers who achieved this status over a decade of loyalty to the airline they bought claiming they had no lifetime member status in executive club, however i believe this is now something they do in fact offer. this is why i have reduced my score to 8/10, otherwise full marks.",29th May 2016,Philippines,Premium Economy,yes,3,Gatwick to Venice,Solo Leisure,No,Positive

flew british airways business class from london heathrow to santorini. the seats are a joke and in reality are economy seats sold as a business class package. no leg room and ba attempt to improve the experience by blocking the middle seat for a 2x2 configuration (a/c and d/e). the problem is they use an upended tray which is bolted into the seat and cannot be moved. at least if the middle seat was vacant couples could stretch across and free up some much needed space. our flight was delayed by a hour traveling out and so we were stuck in our seats for almost five hours. flight was full in business (9 rows taken up) and quickly became stuffy. since this is an economy seat at a business price it is almost impossible to work out bas business strategy. will not fly on this leg again with ba and will take my custom to an alternate airline.,9th May 2016,United Kingdom,Business Class,no,7,LHR to CPT,Couple Leisure,No,Neutral

"london gatwick to amsterdam. i was bumped off this british airways flight as a result of a change of plane, to an a319 i gather. the process was not well handled, and it appeared that some staff and/or standby passengers were given priority, although others also missed out i understand. the main issues were lack of clarity at the airport as to what the issue was, last-minute confirmation of offloading (which left us short of time to take another flight), a poor process for transferring airports (i had to bus from gatwick to heathrow), and poor follow-up when i queried matters afterwards. ba refused to state whether staff or standby passengers had been prioritised, repeatedly citing privacy. i checked with a friend who's a uk privacy legal specialist, and this applies to individuals but not to categories such as staff or standby, so it appears to be a refusal by ba to respond. i also raised the transfer with ba, as this involved further queueing to turn a voucher into a ticket, which meant i missed a transfer bus. better to issue a ticket, or a voucher that can be used on any service that day, with ba to arrange it so with the bus company. on the positive side, i was compensated per the rules, and did make a ba flight later that day, which was ok. nonetheless, this could have been handled much more smoothly, and i'm afraid british airways customer service on the ground and in follow-up let them down.",4th May 2016,New Zealand,Economy Class,no,5,Denver to Heathrow,Family Leisure,No,Positive

"washington to heathrow with british airways and i have to say that the iad ground crew and inflight crew are fantastic. i sprained my neck just 2 days before departure and was given the option to pre board, which made all the difference. the flight itself was amazing - the a380 is just like a rock in the sky, i didn't feel a thing. the seat comfort on the upper deck in coach is more than adequate - in fact it reminds me of economy plus on united. the premium economy is more like domestic business class on most us carriers (older style business class not the new business first). the major downside - as i write this in the middle of my trip - is the ground staff at heathrow. they are hard to find if they even exist. i'm in the middle of a terminal to terminal connection, still wearing my brace - and when asking about gate assignments and better options for seating, the best i got was a brusque ""sorry that's all there is."" when you see someone limping away from your desk - at least ask if they'd like some assistance getting to the departure lounge. i know that with united, they may not offer club access for free, but you can at least buy it and i have found their ground staff at heathrow far superior to the uk's flagship carrier - unfortunately.",28th February 2016,United States,Economy Class,yes,3,BLR to LHR,Business,No,Positive

"british airways from manchester to rio de janeiro via heathrow. weren't invited to the lounge at man due to a rather arrogant check in agent. the concord lounge at lhr has seen better days - ordered a bacon sandwich which arrived far too promptly and was limp and rather pathetic, so left it! champagne on boardng was warm as was the water. nuts were pleasant. seat area was genuinely filthy and had not been thoroughly cleaned with remnants of the toiletries bag between the seats from the last passengers. first choice of food not available, which is unacceptable in first. then a whole row of seats just stopped working so my seat was in a permanent 20 degree incline. staff attempted to get them working but to no avail. we ended being split up, partner on row 4, me on row 2! nice start to our honeymoon, thanks ba. cheese selection on the menu had changed and was offered a scrappy piece of paper to advise new selections. staff upgrades are commonplace on ba in first and the cabin had by my reckoning, 5 paying passengers and i'd say about 4 staff upgrades (all of whom appeared after we had been pushed back from the gate). these 'mates' of crew are showered with attention throughout the flight. personally i'd have preferred to see some of the full fare business class passengers upgraded with staff passengers thankful for a seat, but ba seem to think it's acceptable for staff to travel in first. if you're on flying on business and hoping for an upgrade, i'd say you're chances are pretty remote, unless of course you know one of the crew for that flight! a pretty poor experience all round which proves that the once 'worlds favourite airline' has become so complacent that they can't even get it right in first class. is it any wonder the middle east carriers are showing the rest of the world how to do it!",27th February 2016,United Kingdom,First Class,no,3,Rome to Heathrow,Solo Leisure,No,Positive

"london heathrow to vancouver with british airways. outbound flight was delayed by 2 hours. email was received on the day of travel. it did take 2 calls to the airline to establish if one could arrive later. on the first call, there was such a poor understanding of the question that the operator thought we wanted to rebook flights. fortunately we were cut off as i think the call might have continued for the rest of the day. second call was more successful and a direct answer was given, no matter how unwelcome. printing your own baggage labels was a new experience at lhr (i am not a frequent air traveller). a sign of the times perhaps but i did get the impression of going through a self checkout at a supermarket. not much to say about bag drop off. it was neither efficient nor inefficient, just a linear series of a few tasks performed by someone doing their job. the young chap at drop off said that the delay started as 10 minutes at the beginning of the week which had turned into two hours by friday. at the gate, i did wonder why those with priority boarding moved to a different seating area - all of 3 metres away. i suspect people need to be seen receiving value for higher ticket prices, because they will of course get there first! the flight was just about adequate. my video screen did not work and despite requests to 2 cabin crew this was not rectified - well i was ignored. fortunate, as the film and tv choice was poor.  i do not like airline food that much. there are plenty of food outlets past security to get something decent to eat. never really drink the wine. beer and spirits hard to get wrong. return flight was only made better by the jet stream reducing the flight time by an hour. again the flight was just about adequate. did not eat the food as i had a salad from an outlet at yvr - good value. flight attendant said it looked better than what they were serving. the seat in front of me was broken so it reclined further than it should. the only solution provided by another attendant was to get up walk around a bit, and stand at the back. whilst the broken seat was not the fault of the passenger in front, she did not want to be reasonable. the attendant stood there waiting for me to derive a solution.

"thanks to a time change from 23.55 to 00.05, which brought forward our departure by almost 24 hours, we very nearly missed our flight back from rio de janeiro to london. the check-in desks were crowded out by team gb athletes returning home from a training session and we were relieved to get the fast track treatment. the first/business lounge at gig is one of the worst we've been in. our seats were 1e/f and seemed marginally better than the first class seats on a 747, although still far off the standard of british airways competitors. 1e/f also suffer from being near the galley and there was one crew member who spent much of the night talking away to her colleagues. 1a and 1k seemed to be occupied by ba employees and there was far too much schmoozing going on. service on the whole was reasonably good, although none of the food on the menu was actually available. this was rather feebly blamed on the changeover from one month to the next. the ife worked reliably and the large screen had a much better resolution than on 747s. overnight the temperature in the cabin was set too high, which resulted in an uncomfortable sleep under the duvet in the pyjamas provided. the toilets on the 777 are ridiculously small and weren't well cleaned during the flight. breakfast was the usual affair, with an atrociously rubbery omelette. overall, the flight was okay, but not a first class experience.",2nd February 2016,United Kingdom,First Class,no,7,Rome to Heathrow,Solo Leisure,No,Neutral

"british airways from vienna to newcastle via heathrow return, flights on-time. economy on an a320. fa’s much better on domestic legs, while both times on vie legs the fa’s were professional, but nothing more and not doing more than absolutely required. information from the flight deck was friendly and excellent. a snack and drinks were served - snack a highly processed sandwich (barely edible) on the vie flights and crisps/biscuits on the ncl flights. additional drinks on request. a320 featured the new slim seats and i miss the older more comfortable ba seats with better leg room. ba has recently changed the rules and travelling only with hand baggage now also means that one is no longer allowed to pick a seat during check-in, but a seat is randomly allocated. selecting any seat (even a middle seat in the back of plane now costs eur 18). if one later decides to check a piece of luggage the costs are a whopping eur 75 at the airport or eur 35 online. being oneworld sapphire does not help either. no privileges here; still the same charges for seat selection and checked luggage. so, ba became a low cost model, except for drinks service. however the prices do not reflect this change in service. on the last leg lhr-vie carry-on luggage was heavily policed. although my carry-on luggage met the weight requirements and fits in the overhead bin and has so without any problems on the previous three legs and twenty previous ba flights, i was required to check it in. it was also not a question of occupied space, as it happened in the priority line. hopefully just a power trip by the gate agent. however, here goes the main advantage of ba, which was a carry-on policy that enabled passengers to realistically travel without the hassle of checking bags. boarding by the same agent was again bizarre. instead of priority boarding, there were now four different types of priority boarding, and the procedure left everybody confused and everybody just stood there blocking the access to the gate, so that finally it became a cattle call with everyone boarding at the same time. another thing is, that recent changes in ba’s frequent flyer program make it impossible to reach a meaningful status even for regular flyer unless you regularly fly club on long distance routes. obviously, ba is trying very hard to annoy its frequent travelers. while i stopped flying business with ba probably a year ago after they downgraded their club europe cabin and i was avoiding their long distance flights for a long time due to their terrible seating arrangement, i believe ba’s european economy was a great product and i was using ba regularly for those flights. however, after all these recent changes, i will only book ba if they offer the lowest or close to the lowest fare. for flights to the uk, klm starts to look pretty good again.

"phoenix to london heathrow, and this was our third time flying first class on british airways, and after flying this time, we are disappointed.  the ba lounge in phoenix is disgusting. we could handle it only for about 5 minutes. from the staff, the seats, the space, the food, nothing was orderly, clean, and it all seemed run-down. walking around the airport aimlessly was a much better option. the boarding process was a joke. again, the staff seemed confused, clueless, they called for everyone (all statuses, memberships, traveling with children, etc...all at once. it seemed nearly half of the plane was lined up to get in during premier boarding. there were 3 cabin staff for first class, two out of the three were not at all cordial. no greeting, they seemed to be running around the entire time even when the first class cabin was not full. they were not well groomed or spoke politely - came across unprofessional. this ruined the experience of flying first class. the meal experience was horrible. i ordered an appetizer, salad, and an main course. my husband ordered the 2 appetizers, and a main course. they came back to tell us they were out of one of the appetizers he ordered. first time this has ever happened in first class! they brought my appetizer, which we had to share, and they completely forgot about my salad. they brought the main (chicken dish), which was cold and dry. i had to send it back and changed to a steak. the steak came after about 20 minutes. roughly 1/4 of the steak was hot, the remainder was cold (not even warm). the taste was amazing but ruined the dining experience completely. upon waking up i opted to not have breakfast but have biscuits. the menu had ""assortment of biscuits"" and a few other bistro type items. when i ordered coffee and biscuits, the flight attendant looked concerned and said ""let me see if i can find some biscuits for you"". she came back with a bag of popcorn, a browny, and a few vanilla wafers. typical items served on a domestic us based airline. my husband ordered coffee as well and asked for half and half. she failed to understand half and half and finally said ""oh you mean half and half in british accent. how is it possible to be a flight attendant and you cannot understand an american accent for half and half. normally this would not even be an issue but having experienced all of the above this just seemed like the icing on the cake. toilets were small, cramped, and dirty with no typical first class amenities available within the toilets. our next leg was within eu to munich on another ba flight where the service on a 737 surpassed their international first class! seat is comfortable but that's about it!",18th December 2015,United States,First Class,no,3,Heathrow to Las Vegas,Family Leisure,No,Negative

"third time flying the british airways a380 and the only reason that we did is because it was a ba amex 2for1 redemption. however to ensure that we maxed out the experience, as always we pre booked seats. on checking in online seats had been moved, contacted ba bronze and reply was ""cannot answer why, possibly operational reasons, more information should be available at check in"". check in, no response. on board our seats were occupied by what appeared to be ""normal"" passengers, i.e. no entourage. seats we were allocated, lumbar and head rest functions did not operate, cabin crew tried rebooting but no luck, so onwards and upwards. having flown ba a reasonable amount i have come to the conclusion that the cabin crew, despite operating with poorly designed cabins, poorly maintained (seats) equipment (we had a similar scenario on a heathrow to la and return last july where we had the same reg plane, same seats and similar problem which was not fixed after the flight out) manage to maintain a brave company face. ba club lounge: again, food choice poor, running out, although granted peak hours, but if other airlines can cope why cannot ba? cabin crew: service very good and friendly. food reasonable, but nothing that makes you say that ""that was good"". entertainment: poor, old ""ish"" and second rate movies, enough said. seats: unfortunately in this case we leave the worst till last. having flown qantas, emirates and qatar a380's like everybody else we wonder why ba did not take the opportunity for a redesign of layout and seat area. well we know why = £££'s, question? does no one on the ba cabin design team wear glasses? there is no storage space, if it goes in the drawer with the shoes, you have to move the seat from sleep position to access, so you are left with the possibility of either wearing and damaging said specs, or hanging them over the separator. again, competitors manage it. the seat itself, is harder than the competitors above (mattress?) and apparently i discovered that extra pillows are no longer carried, so you have one and thats it. unfortunately, we do still have to use ba next march, but have booked qatar again for october. additionally, the customer service service in india is sadly woefully short in all areas, although polite working from scripts and unable to solve / answer simple questions. frustration. a question for ba: we really want to support and be proud of our national flag carrier but what are the incentives for using ba? i do not mean cost.",16th December 2015,United Kingdom,Business Class,no,3,BKK to LHR,Business,No,Negative

"i have been flying to the us regularly from england and have noticed a consistent erosion in the quality of its booking process, website, call centre and ground staff. the british airways website is unreliable and prone to returning baffling errors even when carrying out the simplest of activities. its upgrade path is impenetrable and designed to confuse, call centre staff do not seem to speak english and make ridiculous requests and ground staff are didactic. examples: cannot check in online, but via the app on a smartphone, no problem (except i wanted a printed boarding pass). call centre staff in india wanted to speak to my 5 year old daughter when my family accompanied me one one trip, as she was on a different booking and wouldn't give me her flight reference number ""for security reasons"". no problem with ""security reasons"" when i paid ba a lot of money for the ticket. upgrading with points or avios fails in the middle of a transaction. the system remains unavailable to check you in for some time after, so you have to call the call centre. ba blacks out so many flights from purchasing with avios, it's not worth trying unless you're jobless and can fly any time, and don't care where you go. in the queue for boarding my passport wasn't open at the right page and the staff at the gate admonished me as a result. on another occasion at passport control after checking in i was directed back to the ba desk i'd just come from. ""there's nothing wrong with your passport, it must be baa. it's not us"", was the response. it took a huffing, tutting, ba duty manager to run the visa check again. i advise people to avoid ba if possible. the only reason for choosing ba is flight safety. but other airlines manage that too, with a smile. so, no excuse.",11th December 2015,United Kingdom,Premium Economy,no,3,London to Tampa,Couple Leisure,No,Negative

"i have flown british airways business class and was pleased with lounge, food service, elemis spa, showers wit elemis products and on request champagne. onboard with comfortable fully reclining seats, duvet and amenities appropriately dispersed per sex. staff friendly and accommodating, cabin (upper deck- a380) clean and comfortable. my next trip in august was last minute with just first available. i felt very comfortable booking this since my experience in business has always been very nice. my past experiences with first prior to renovated cabins, separate seating cells- i felt it was still going to be a lovely, comfortable experience, with enjoyable food. so, with all the changes in first now, i thought i would really be in for a relaxing treat. i want to preface this by saying i have always loved british airways and has always been my first choice for london- houston, jfk-london flights for years. i had a early flight. checked in in ample time before my flight. i went straight to the concorde room to have breakfast. what i was met with was basically a cafeteria style, self serve service. there was no table service, two people working behind the food counter. i met an english couple while waiting in-line to put in a simple scramble eggs on toast order as they and we were both told that the toaster was in front of us, and we needed to toast on own bread. it all went downhill from there. the wait was long, traveling on your own you had to keep an eye on your table to make sure it was not taken, tables were left unserviced and unclean. i carried some dishes to the front just so i could be seated. boarded plane, seated, and started looking around and the carpet was dirty. it looked as it had not been vacuumed from the last flight, which did not give me a clean and comfortable feeling. the the steward came to me and said they ran out of women's toiletry kits because they do not allot according to reservation, but normally catering to men traveling on business and not women traveling on pleasure. he offered a men's toiletry kit and a business class kit. the food was served. i started with their appetizers which was all dry and very unappetizing (and i am not picky), but for me to find it unappealing it has to be poor. then the entrees were short and i had to choose a second choice. any one of these events would be okay- even though they advertised that all is superb, but everything, constantly occurring had me regretting i paid for first and have sworn, for the price differential vs service and quality,  business class wins out hands down. the food was far from septacular or tasty - it felt overcooked and choices limited and short. the pilot did come out and asked if ba could call me and he was very apologetic (i guess a steward/ess mentioned the faux pas's  - i consented. disappointment ran consistent from beginning to end - no call, no email, no apology - in my opinion that is the epitome of service from beginning to end. it left me feeling that ba really did not care about any of it - the service in lounges, the appropriate allocation of food, kits, cleanliness- all of it. my flight back to jfk i flew business. it was comfortable. though there was less space in first class seats years ago, but the service was brilliant and comfortable and the food was delicious. i am sad my experience this time could not compare to years gone by - even if it was more simplistic. my review is for first only.",10th December 2015,United States,First Class,no,5,BKK to LHR,Business,No,Positive

"london heathrow to las vegas with british airways. online check in and seat allocation facility 24 hours before departure are a con! i checked the available flight seats approximately 30 hours prior to check in and virtually 95% of the flight was pre-booked! therefore, i panicked and prepaid the £70 to secure a window and middle seat as seats had not been allocated to me and wouldn't be until 24hours prior to check in. then when i did check in approximately 23hrs and 59 minutes prior to travel i had already been allocated 2 seats, one by a window and one in the middle, so a total waste of time me paying £70. i got a refund, but only have the inconvenience of completing online forms and waiting around a month to get my money back. then when i did get to the airport, the seats i had already paid the extra £70 for had been allocated to someone else (after i had paid for them)and they told me i had to sit in my original 2 seats that had been allocated - an utter farce! british airways refused to acknowledge their systems were at fault and had use of my funds for almost a month yet had i been advised of my seats prior to check in i would not have paid them £70. they knowingly do this to encourage people to pre-pay for something they knowingly cannot deliver. the aircraft was dirty when we boarded as the fight was late, the toilets were blocked around 10 minutes into the flight and stank - eventually they were blocked off from use, which left 2 out of 4 toilets for the entire rear section of the plane.  the food was abysmal. afternoon tea on a transatlantic flight used to be pleasant, with scones, cream, jam and nice selection of sandwiches. now it is a dried up roll and dried excuse of a cake. i am never going to fly british airways again after the way they handled my complaint - they offered no form of apology that was meaningful or relevant to what i was complaining about and disowned responsibility for the corrupt way their online booking system works.

"washington to dubai via london return with british airways. my concern is regarding seat allocation. when we booked our flight (2 adults, one child and one infant), the seats with the bassinets for the infants were not available. we then chose 3 seats together on the side. i presumed that those are granted first come first served, based on the needs of the passengers that are traveling with children. nonetheless, in 3 out of the 4 flights we took, those seats were taken by single individuals with no children/infants accompanying them. i asked at the check in if the seats with the bassinets were occupied by people with infants and the ground attendant responded by ""yes"". that was not the case, unfortunately. the flights were therefore very uncomfortable due to not having a place for the infant while food and drinks were served. i do not understand that when you try to book those seats with the bassinet, the system does not grant priority to the people traveling with infants. british airways should consider that instead of having passengers with the hassle of keeping their infants on their laps for 7-8 hours while the bassinets are empty. the priority seating chart is for that purpose useful.

"i think one word sums it up 'rubbish'. the london to barbados flight was passable, however the return journey was a joke. it started at grantley adams airport where passengers were bumped off the flight through overbooking, we fortunately, were there early enough to be able to get onto the flight. we sat down and found that the seat in front of me was broken, so i had to spend the eight hour flight with the seat in my face, the gentleman in front was very apologetic however it was not his fault. there were no headsets and only two cots on board, in spite of numerous babies needing this facility, leading to very fractious and tired little ones, a nightmare for parents i would presume. next the food, abysmal! a choice of peri peri chicken or pasta with tomato and cheese, no cheese and a thick horrible overpowering spicy tomato sauce, revolting. the tea and coffee was served at the same time as the food so if you wanted to eat and have wine, by the time you got to your tea or coffee it was cold - (obviously cabin crew in a hurry to clear). breakfast was an all time low, a cold congealed croissant with a little butter and jam plus what can only be described as a bird seed bar. i have travelled with british airways for more than 40 years and have never had food like this on a long haul flight, or in face any flight. many years ago when i used to travel from singapore and malaysia with british airways the food was excellent, even in economy, menu, three choices of main meals and cooked breakfast that was always very good. the cabin crew could not care less and somehow fail to realise that we, the customer, actually pay their wages. i asked for milk for my tea instead of the creamer for coffee that was provided albeit in miniscule amounts and was told by cabin crew that the creamer was ok. i did not feel like a paying customer at all, just a nuisance. british airways have lost the plot and are up against great airlines such as emirates and singapore airlines, although sadly not on the barbados route.

"i decided to fly british airways as it is now the only oneworld carrier with premium economy between sydney and singapore, since qantas now only runs a330s with business and basic economy into singapore. it was a pleasant surprise with very good service and food and a pleasant ambience onboard. almost all passengers were flying onto london and this also applied to the return run from singapore, with almost all passengers originating in london. this means that for the return flight from singapore most other people had slept all the way from london and were chatting and moving about the cabin, meaning it was almost impossible to get any sleep on the relatively short overnight flight between singapore to sydney. so, if you don't mind skipping any sleep between singapore and sydney this is a nice alternative when planning to fly from australia to singapore and return. many passengers had their window blinds shut during the landing approaches into singapore and also sydney when i understood just the opposite was supposed to be the case for safety reasons. not sure why ba allows this to happen.",17th November 2015,Australia,Premium Economy,yes,3,Rome to Heathrow,Solo Leisure,No,Positive

"glasgow to rome return via heathrow on a ba city break package. short delay outbound due to fog in glasgow and about 1 hr delay on return from rome. four excellent flights, heathrow-glasgow leg re-booked in rome by check-in desk in anticipation of delay. the connection was tight so we were pleasantly surprised to find our luggage had made in onto the glasgow flight. cabin crew and catering excellent (i didn't like the type of sandwich so was offered a lovely salad instead). best cup of tea i've had on a flight.",16th November 2015,United Kingdom,Economy Class,yes,7,Denver to Heathrow,Family Leisure,No,Positive
"cape town to london heathrow. the new british airways lounge at cape town is a big improvement on the lounge that used to be shared with virgin, however it filled up quickly with passengers for the two flights. our new first class seats (2a/3a) were already showing their age, so the plane was probably one of the first to be retrofitted. unfortunately, the crew in first were young and disinterested. neither of us were addressed by our names at any point during the flight. the dinner service was slow and the food mediocre (cold and dry or overcooked and dry). ironically, they ran out of the south african white wine. the entertainment system wasn't working for most of the flight. british airways should provide an ipad alternative in first when that happens. pjs and the flat bed made up with a duvet are good touches, but the flight was too turbulent for uninterrupted sleep. the boeing 747-400 toilets are ridiculously small for changing in and out of clothes. overall, the experience was underwhelming.",15th November 2015,United Kingdom,First Class,no,3,BKK to LHR,Business,No,Neutral
"british airways are not the upmarket world class brand they were. fact. everything is about saving whilst extorting. the lounge at gatwick and t5 had no hot food until certain times - like school.  a while back they're was always superb lounge food and not salty kettle chips! people have paid for this and british airways is not delivering which is really wrong. bought sandwich from downstairs because lounge had no decent food. onboard only a tiny amount of club world passengers, yet they ran out of preferred meal choices. starting to wonder just how the cabin crew are treated, because if they are treated the way passengers are, no wonder they've stopped caring. so sad for what was an iconic brand.

"travelled british airways from london heathrow to buenos aires return in business class. business class layout is terrible with very narrow seats which are arrangend in way that almost in any seat you book, somebody will step over you during the night or you have to step over somebody else. in addition, there are screens between and your neighbor's seat which flight attendants have to move up and down when they want to serve passengers who do not have an aisle seat. i can't imagine how stupid the person who created this layout must have been. it is not comfortable for passengers nor is it for flight attendants. very sticky atmosphere due to this odd arrangement of seats. in terms of service, this was lousy on both flights. there are about 4 flight attendants for about 40 business class seats. the flight attendants are quite old. it takes them a long time to get you something to drink on the table after take-off. they move through the cabin twice with drinks before they serve dinner and desert. afterwards you don't see them and they may not show up even if you press the call button. their attitude is by and large correct, but very formal and impersonal. they clearly don't display any signs of fun or interest in the customer. food was reasonable. no wifi available at all.",15th November 2015,Germany,Business Class,no,3,London to Sydney,Couple Leisure,No,Positive
"i have been loyal british airways and found little to complain about. the last two long hauls i have done this year with ba has seen the passengers wearing winter coats when flying to the tropics due to the cabin being kept freezing. but my main complaint is the nice little earner ba have come up with where you pay seat allocation and extra for bulkhead or emergency exit seats where there is more leg room. i have now paid the high rate on numerous occasions only to find the plane configuration has changed and i am in a regular seat, the crew have been known to ask me for proof! today's flight was no exception, i wasn't even given an apology or a refund but told to keep my voice down. the crew looked tired and just going through the motions. my loyalty may have come to an end and i am seriously considering air mauritius or emirates for my next trip.",14th November 2015,United Kingdom,Economy Class,yes,3,LHR to CPT,Couple Leisure,No,Negative
"flight and crew great, the problems came when we had to deal with the orlando check in staff and customer complaints in uk. total nightmare and they just did not care at all. our seats were booked 3 months in advance as we had a small baby with us. when arriving at orlando airport to return home the check in agent changed our seats to mid row and no bassinets. we noticed before going through security and returned to advise to get our seats that we had booked back. this turned into 2 hours of sheer hell with the staff (including airport manager) while my baby screamed the place down hungry, as we could not go through security until they had rectified the problem. the staff were rude and arrogant and refused to admit they had messed up and refused to change our seats back as they had seated someone else there who had no baby. even though these seats are reserved for people with babies due to the bassinet availability. eventually it was changed back after so much stress and hassle. on returning we complained and 3 times we got the answer yes it was our fault we are sorry but we can't give anything to say sorry for our behaviour. eventually after another complaint they agreed to 3000 avios and £25 voucher. i won't be flying with british airways again as they are so bad in customer relations and check in agents leave a lot to be desired.",14th November 2015,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,5,BLR to LHR,Business,No,Negative
"heathrow to las vegas with british airways, and a farcical flight to be honest. 2 hours into a 10 hour flight running out of beer for those who drink is a joke. not having the choice of food by the time it comes to you on 4 occasions over the 2 flights is pathetic - i guess you need to really consider where you book your seats by asking where they start serving from. i thought air stewardesses were meant to at least crack a smile once and again, and when asked reasonable questions (that had to be asked due to the ridiculous shortages) were meant to be as accommodating and friendly as possible? hope i never have to fly with british airways again.",14th November 2015,United Kingdom,Economy Class,no,5,Heathrow to Las Vegas,Family Leisure,No,Positive

"gatwick to venice with british airways. the plane was clean, crew good and reasonably on time, with good check in. but the flight was made unpleasant by ba encouraging people to take so much cabin baggage on to the plane. the return flight was perhaps 80% full, but the overhead lockers were full. it causes a scrum at boarding. the back row passengers board first and stowed their cases at the front so they don't have to carry them down the plane. the lockers are than full when the forward rows boarded they had nowhere to stow theirs. it was then chaos while the cabin crew sorted it out. it should be every passengers right to not have luggage under their feet.",13th November 2015,United Kingdom,Economy Class,yes,3,Gatwick to Venice,Solo Leisure,No,Neutral

"not impressed with british airways at all. we flew back from denver after visiting family. we flew out with lufthansa as they were the cheapest as we usualy fly to the middle/far east with them and know the standards and quality they have to offer. our return lufthansa flight home was cancelled due to flight attendant strikes at lufthansa. we were booked straight on to the ba flight back to london which left only an hour later. initially we were excited to fly with british airways as it would've been our first time flying with them and also they fly a b747-400 from denver to europe. i am aware that the boeing 747-400 isn't the newest aircraft, however lufthansa had re-done the interior with new seats and side panels so very up to date inside. with british airways the whole interior was very old and dirty, the seats hadn't been changed and the tv's in the back of the seats were such poor quality it was embarrassing. the food was of a poor standard - chicken meal i had was horrendous and even the flight attendant didnt know what she was serving. when asked what chicken dish it was, she replied ""some sort of curry thing"" when it was actually chicken teryaki. the air hostess was rude, the breakfast snack which was served before landing was also not very good, and cereal bar was rock hard. british airways were double the price of lufthansa when we initially booked, however i would never choose to fly with the again out of my own choice. their boeing 747's are dated which is a massive shame. stick to an airline you know well, lufthansa are the best european airline all round that i have used, and emirates was the best internationally. i hope this review was helpful - obviously i am aware some customers would have had a better experience than me on newer planes with different food and air hostesses, however be aware when booking with british airways as they are very over rated and not good value for money.

"roundtrip with british airways from bangkok to london in club world. really the only good thing to talk about is the baggage allowance. the seats are horrid. cramped and you feel like you're in a coffin if you have the backward-facing window seats. it's unbelievably cramped and when i pay more than 4x the economy ticket, i expect a place to keep a water bottle when the seat is in bed-mode. the main meal outbound was not heated and had to be returned.  the pre-ordered beef on the inbound was dry. changed it for the cold king prawn salad with couscous only to be told it was actually chicken. the bathrooms are hideous and there's no distinction between economy and business. blocked washbasin, tissue fibres all over the place, stained walls and peeling finishes. crew outbound were older and very pleasant. inbound was a much younger crew and only one (spanish lady) was truly aware of passenger needs. the rest were more intent on getting to bangkok to party than to serve passengers with a smile. boarding at lhr they were all in the galley blocking access to the other side of the cabin, chattering to each other and not one welcome or eye-contact after entering the door. the club word lounge meal offerings at t5 were abysmal. more like a school canteen. if anyone from ba reads these opinions, then please do something about your dreadful ife. it's archaic and that's being polite. fuzzy, small screens and if you choose a movie with subtitles, they're illegible.
